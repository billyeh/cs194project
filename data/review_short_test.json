The only bad thing is that it's too close to where we live, so I can expect my sugar intake to go through the roof now.\n\nAs you walk up, it's easy to be overwhelmed by the signage and menu, as they seem to have everything that you could ever imagine. In fact, you might just be better off walking up and ordering whatever you want without looking at the menu. Odds are, they'll just smile and run off to make it. I mean, if they have toasted coconut soft serve ice cream, what don't they have, right?\n\nThe people that work there are all really pleasant and the ice cream is excellent! It is cash only, so that might be a downside if you're just randomly stopping by for the first time, but it's one place where the long lines are truly warranted in this town. Don't worry, though, usually the line isn't actually long at all. They take your order quickly at Page and your order will actually be up impressively fast for the amount of people ordering thanks to Page Dairy Mart's army of ice cream servers on staff. That \"line\" of people will disappear as quickly as a new one appears.\n\nA night hasn't gone by since our first visit that my wife and I haven't wanted to go back. Only our conscious willpower has kept us away, and there aren't a lot of places that have left me feeling that way, so kudos to Page Dairy Mart and their staff! \n\nHeck, it's snowing today, and I'm probably going to go!", "type": "review", "business_id": "2PfavOTufsPCRdYm-bFcpw"}

It is located in Mekong and looks like it is a part of a food court with a bunch of random tables. We ordered the dan dan noodles ($5), pork and vegetables potstickers($4.60), and the short rib soup($6)The lady at the counter was very sweet and helpful with our order and unlike a previous reviewer experienced, our food arrived in nearly 7 minutes max. It seemed like the gyoza takes the longest because that arrived last for us and another customer their ordered gyoza that arrived very slowly. The food was all fantastic. I highly recommend the dan dan noodles. The noodles are home made and the sauce is fantastic. They give you tons of it and never skimp on the meat. But the flavor alone is incredible, it's spicy, maybe a little bit sweet, fresh from green onions and cilantro, and the meat sauce packed even more flavor. The short rib soup on the other hand was not as \"lively\" but my mom who ordered it said the flavor was still great and it tasted like the soup her mom made. She also noted that the short ribs were cooked perfectly. I took a bite and I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is a fan of brothy soups. The gyoza was also cooked very good. The skin may have been a little thicker that I prefer, but the filling is great. I could eat the meat in it by itself! I also recommend that, because Im not normally a potsticker fan! Our experience was really good and we also ended up taking 40 frozen gyoza home($10)! The vibe we got from it is that it had a Very homelike feel to it. It is truly just great home cooking! We are happy to have found this place and we will definitely be back soon. \n\nPros: \n-Great Food\n-Cheap\n-No Msg\n-All homemade stuff (noodles and chili sauce are made in store!)\n\nCons:\n-The seating area is gross, so we will probably take out food from here next time\n-They have a jug of water that you get yourself but it's room temperature\n-Gyoza can take a long time from what I've gathered", "type": "review", "business_id": "2zag3j-zdjBsDtIbVYXxLg"}

Bread was served, which was moist and included two different varieties. Good stuff.\n\nOn the menu it says all fresh pastas are made in house daily. Although this may give the impression that all their pastas are made in house, in fact it is quite the contrary. It deceptively means that all of their pastas which are homemade, are made in the restaurant.... Oh, so it is a play on words in an attempt to trick the patron? \n\nI was interested in a seafood dish and asked if the pasta in the dish was homemade and fresh. The waiter said in order to get that dish with the homemade pasta it was going to be $7 more than the price of the entree, which was already $20. So I am paying a third of the price of the dish for homemade pasta? No thanks. I then asked which of the entrees already came with the homemade pasta, and the waiter said only one dish had the homemade pasta. Despite the pasta situation, I decided to stay with the Fradiavolo with \"marinara sauce\" and asked for the noodles on the side.\n\nWe placed our order, were served our soups and salads soon, and received the Cannelloni and Fradiavolo shortly thereafter.\n\nOn the plus side, the mushroom soup was one of the best we've ever had. Very earthy, rich, and flavorful. If I had a hankering for cream of mushroom soup, and there were no other known locations for a great soup, I would likely come back just for that; kudos.\n\nThe Cannelloni, which was supposed to be \"baked in bechamelle\" looked as if the two crepes were baked, then topped with sauce afterwards. The meat inside was pale, and the dish seemed under-seasoned. We decided to switch it out for a veal dish.\n\nThe seafood fradiavolo, which was supposed to be in a marinara sauce (which gives the reader the impression that it would be thick like a traditional marinara sauce), was in a thin, broth-like sauce. Regardless, I was satisfied with the taste of the dish and the sauce, but the reason I ordered the dish was because I thought it would be unique with a thick sauce, whereas other restaurants typically serve this type of seafood dish in a broth-like sauce. The shrimp had the tails on, which I though was odd given that all the seafood was submerged in the sauce. In order to de-tail the shrimp I needed to get my hands dirty, which seemed out of place in this type of restaurant.\n\nThe replacement veal arrived soon. The sides were delicious, the veal however was not. It again was bland, pale, and soggy. Although the preparation of veal scaloppine should include breading and being sauteed, this veal seemed like it was almost boiled, rather than sauteed. The veal had a lot of white floating fat pieces, those that you get when boiling a chicken and not straining off the fat. Next, when cutting into the veal, a large artery was immediately found. We questioned the staff, and they said the veal comes in daily and is hand-trimmed. Well props to you, but if the veal is hand trimmed, wouldn't a large 1/4\" artery be easily found in a thin cut of veal?\n\nDespite being let down with the entrees, we decided to try the Tiramisu. It was decent; we did not find lady fingers in the dessert. Instead it was layered with a more traditional cake. We are suckers for good Tiramisu, but we were let down.\n\nRecapping:\nGood - Cream of mushroom soup, appetizer bread.\nUgh - Bland and soggy meat, artery in veal, all the pasta is NOT handmade (expect to pay 33% more to get this in your dish), tails on shrimp in a sauce dish, and the small restaurant got quite loud later in the evening with the accordion player stopping at every table.", "type": "review", "business_id": "MPyxaNVuWlAQqJ0iKV5rQw"}

It was shaved meat, not sliced meat. The flavor was spot on - but the texture was just...odd. And - my fault - I don't care for lettuce on my gryo - just the meat, tomato, onion, and tzatziki. The menu said lettuce - I should have asked for that to be left off. (It's impossible to get all the lettuce shreds off of sauced shredded meat.)\n\nThe chicken shawarma was okay - again, nothing wrong with it. But it was a bit too heavily seasoned. To the point I couldn't really tell it was chicken. \n\nThe baklava was perfect - and I will be back to check out more of the menu. Next time, I will ask the owner if he can slice the gyro a bit (a lot) thicker - more like the consistency of every other gyro I've ever had anywhere - and hold the lettuce.

Wow, I'm glad I did. I have lived in Vegas for half a decade already and this is by far the best indian buffet restaurant in Vegas. The price is reasonable (8.99), but the food is what made them apart from other indian places. The tandoori chicken was flavorful and moist ( other places tends to have dried out chicken) and the curries were awesome. They removed the bone from the chicken and lamb curries so it was so much easier to eat and not bite into one of those small bones. So many other varieties, so little time and stomache space. =)", "type": "review", "business_id": "D_BMUHbZk67hzRcK3xQQmg"}

I hadn't known that they had one near my work, so I was exciiiited.  My hubs has been wanting me to try this place for the longest.  He works up North, but we live on the opposite side of town so I never agreed to going there until we were on that side of town.  Well that never came around, but here I am at their other location.  We came right when they opened and I have to say that this restaurant gets really busy.  So if you are in a rush, they even put a sign up saying that there will be a wait.  \n\nWell I had every intention of trying one of their fusion Tacos or Burritos, but I basically had my mind set when I saw the Bulgogi plate.  I was so thankful that they brought us chips, salsa, and guacamole.  I was so hungry.  Guacamole was awesome!  On to my main dish.  \n\nCan I tell you that I was impressed?  I would be the type to try what their best known for, but I went on a limb and just did Korean.  The bulgogi is flavored right, the fried rice is a great option to compliment your choice of protein, and if you think thats too much carbs and protein you can add on veggies which is what I did.  Oh, the hot sauce, on point!  I'm pretty sure its made there.  It has a really nice kick to it.  \n\nI want to return and try their bulgogi fries and a burrito, however, I'll need my husband to assist on finishing their large portions.

The food is good and the lunch specials are great and economical. Complimentary chips and salsa while you wait for your order is also a plus. \n\nSome folks don't like the fact that the building is an old temple themed building, but personally I like it. I like the fact that it's the original Macayo's building from the 60's, but maybe I'm more of a purist. Would I prefer for it to be torn down and have a modern establishment with touch screen ordering and wi-fi and all that other technology? No. But that's just me. \n\nThe staff is friendly and courteous, this is also a plus. It's preferable over rude or neutral tempered staff right? The waiter held a conversation with us concerning Obama's visit to Macayo's.\n\nFor the \"Mex & Match\" lunch special I ordered a cheese enchilada and chile relleno with a side of beans. The enchilada was very good and even the beans were very good, as simple as beans are. My only issue was the chile relleno. It didn't have much of a chile flavor to it, kinda bland. It tasted more like the sauce it was topped with. But don't hold this against Macayo's. These type of chile's spiciness and flavor are very random. I know this from my experience with eating them. One can be very flavorful and spicy and the next one can be bland. So, I'm not gonna hold that bland chile against Macayo's. \n\nIf your wondering about price, I spent about $11.00 for this meal including the drink. My only issue with the service was the same waiter who conversed with us about Obama's visit, asked for a tip at the begging when he introduced himself. It sounded rehearsed and something to the effect of: \"Hi my name is so-and-so, I am your waiter today, a small tip would be appreciated...etc.\" I don't like that. I was planning to leave a tip, and I'm sure most people leave one, so asking for a tip to me almost sounds like begging. Other than that, no problems. \n\nI plan future trips.", "type": "review", "business_id": "jzPMl-NoB5F2fwoHX3hN8A"}

I was tended to several times with an update as to when my order would be taken. FOOD, let's get to the food. The Butternut Squash Tacos were the most petite little things. Seemingly small portioned these tacos were satisfying. The squash was perfectly cooked and there was a blend of black beans and sun flower seed to lend some protein. The guacamole was unique with Parmesan, sun flowers and a bit of smoke. The salsa was also an Arbol smoky.  The HEAT challenged my mojo. I thought I wanted a 7 out of 10 kind of heat. They gave me mild with a side of the pure goodness. The smoke definitely comes from the hot sauce. It's a heat that build for a few seconds and lights on fire when you try to wash it down.

The Wynn provided the best of both worlds - quality and a great selection.  \n\nAll of the usual breakfast items were available, including a made to order omelet station, waffles, french toast, pancakes, breakfast meats, and plenty of fresh fruit and pastry.  The hands down favorite of the group were the hot mini cinnamon rolls.  They looked like ordinary small danishes, but they were so warm, and flaky that we just kept eating more.    \n\nOther hits included the dim sum station with delicious pot stickers, pork buns, and spring rolls.  They also had a jook bar, which was a bit bland but unique for a Vegas buffet.  There were kobe beef sliders, prime rib, pizza, sushi, shrimp cocktail, salads, smoked fish, civeche, and lots of pastas.  The desserts were great and included ice cream (scoops, not that crappy soft-serve stuff), and several small portions of various cakes, tarts, puddings, and mousses.  \n\nI left brunch so full that I did not ever think I would eat again.  Of course I totally returned for breakfast on Monday.  The selection was smaller than at brunch, but we stayed long enough to see the lunch selection as well.  If you come around 10:30 you can pay the breakfast price ($19) and get to try lunch as well which rolls out around 11am.

After all there were several \"signs of goodness\" as carefully evaluated my surroundings upon entering Heidi's. \n\nSign #1 this place was going to be good; they were very busy when I walked in; hence there might be a reason why, busy usually = good eats.     \n\nSign #2 this place was going to be good; I noticed there were a lot of older peeps, aka snow-birds eating here as I walked in; hence there might be a reason why, older peeps usually know where the good deli's are.     \n\nSign #3 this place was going to be good; the smell of fresh cooked bread hits you in the face as you walk in; hence there might be a reason why, fresh cooked bread usually = fresh cooked everything\n\nWell to my chagrin this did not hit mark but it was an enjoyable experience. My hot pastrami was shaved cold cut and heated. My rye was the best feature of this main event.  It was awesome, well balanced with just enough crisp vs chew and extremely fresh. My potato salad and cole slaw was store bought not fresh.  I asked the person that was waiting on me why they don't offer more fresh options and she stated it's all about the bread and their fresh approach to sandwich selections.  \n\nThey offer several different sandwich selections other than the traditional such as a chipotle chicken with guac, spicy may, veggies on a baguette or bread of your choice.  I sampled that as well on a second visit and it was good but most definitely not east coast.\n\nLesson learned; Pay no attention to \"signs\" for people have different taste and expectations of what a good deli should be in Phoenix.  Heidi's is a great alternative to burger and fries. They have wonderful breads and offer a good selection of sandwiches, salads and soups.", "type": "review", "business_id": "NtmLlKfCFfM0K5j6WWKxQA"}

Sure, you can see the sign out by the road, but the sign announces three separate businesses and there is no discernible entrance. You have to park in the back lot and walk in from the rear. There is no sign above the door. I wouldn't have found it if I hadn't known to look for it, and if I hadn't been brave enough to blindly walk into an unmarked business. You could park on the side, right where you pull in off of Central Avenue, but know that you must go in at the middle point where the two buildings meet, and it feels like a back-door entrance. You must be cool enough to know how to get in the place. (joking).\n\nThe menus are shit. Meaning, you really have to look around hard to find the menus--it's not like there is a big wall menu above the counter, which is how it SHOULD be. It makes it tough for people in line to decide what they want, because everyone is craning their necks around everyone else in line just to read the posted menu. It is TERRIBLE. So they should improve on that. However, that being said, the bakery items on display look fab, and to taste them is divine. I wound up grabbing a box of pastries and a coffee to go. Best scones EVER, and worth $3 a piece because they're big.\n\nMy Americano was not that good--it tasted like it was made from instant coffee. But at $3 it was big and it was hot and it was coffee. That was okay for me, but I probably will not order that there again. It looks like they have lots of much more interesting choices to choose from, and if I had more time I would have tried something other than my old stand-by.\n\nThe food menu exists...you have to use bifocals. But look for it because the lunch and breakfast entrees look WONDERFUL. The seating looks more conducive to coffee and cocktail drinking. There is a big long table inside that looks like you can eat a meal at it. It is community style dining. There are tables in back, and tables outside that look like you can eat comfortably there.\n\nI have to point out that it is the most hipster/pretentious place EVER but in a good way. If you feel uncomfortable being judged by the hipster group, don't go. It is a really cool place and I plan on taking my sister there. She'll love it. My kids would hate it, but they are teenagers and think they're  too cool to be seen there, if that makes any sense. I loved it but in a fishbowl kind of way. I am not that cool, but I liked looking.

Ignore for a second how preposterously pompous it is that I am required to make an appointment with a \"genius\" , which apparently to Apple means someone with too many tattoos and piercings, also ignore that there were no geniuses available for 6 days, just focus on the fact that I have an appointment. It is for 2:30.\n\nI get to the store at 2:25 and walk in. There has got to be 30 employees working in the store based on the number of blue shirts. This impresses me- that is a lot of people working there on a Saturday. A few of them greet me and I let them know I am here to  see a genius. They direct me to the back of the store and tell me to wait in a little line. it is now about 2:30. I have arrived on time for my scheduled genius time.\n\n2:45 I am finally met by a genius, we will call him Einstein. Einstein informs me that he is not the actual genius that will be helping me, he is just the genius that is checking me in- a job worthy of a genius. He asks me why I am here (something I filled out online and something the greeter already asked me). He lets me know that another Genius, lets call him Tesla, will be helping me shortly.\n\n2:55 Tesla greets me and asks me why I am here. We rehash it. He then gets a macbook out and checks to see if my phone qualifies for battery replacement on the website. He then repeats the process on an Ipad. This is baffling but he is pretty fast so the whole thing takes 10 seconds. He sort of blabbers/fills time for about 5 minutes while he does who knows what on his ipad before taking my phone and telling me it will be done in 45 minutes.\n\nI then go to Gordon Ramsay's Pub and knock back some drinks to cope with this whole process, the highlight of the trip.\n\n4:30 I return well after the 45 minutes this would allegedly take. We repeat the same process- 20 people ask me the same questions about why I am here. I am here to pick up a phone. In hindsight I know this involves someone walking up to me and handing me the phone- there is no paperwork, i didn't need to check anything or sign something, literally someone needs to hand me a phone.  Eventually I am informed that a lady genius, lets call her Marie, is the only genius who can get my phone ( I asked). As she is working for her 77 cents on the dollar Marie is dealing with about 5 other customers at once as 20 dude geniuses roam around the store shooting the breeze. Real nice apple. During this time I have a conversation, and by that I mean I am spit on, by another customer who is picking up his computer and has been waiting for 45 minutes. Not encouraging. After waiting about 20 minutes I spy a genius just sitting on a stool literally staring at the wall. I walk over and say Marie told me to ask him to get my phone, which he then does.\n\nFor the number of employees present, the organization of this place is terrible making customer service useless. I get that there may only be a few people trained to actually replace the battery, but a Monkey could have done the sign in/pickup process so there is no excuse for it taking more than a minute. Also, I had a reservation. I don't think apple knows what reservations mean. Anyone can TAKE reservations, you have to actually enforce them.", "type": "review", "business_id": "EwVBiaXu13SQAZfV0cddWA"}

Or you can order more because they leave your credit card open until you leave the bar area.  The bar room was decorated in ice with windows allowing you to look out into the mall at the regular people not in our igloo.  It is cool and strange and I would recommend it, but I probably would not do it again.  It's a unique experience, but not worth the money to do it twice.  Plus it's really cold and I don't think I could stand to be in there for two drinks.

It had sleek colored booths, framed pictures of movie stars, and get this - pendant lighting! Granted, pendant lighting has become as ubiquitous in restaurants as jukeboxes used to be, but it's still strange that fast food franchises have even jumped on the decor bandwagon. Anyway, the people working at this location are super-friendly, although the staff does tend to be more motivated when a location is relatively new (this one is about a year old), and the food we got was to be expected. I do love BK's French Toast Sticks for a nutrition-less but delicious Saturday morning breakfast, and my husband's sausage muffin was good (although he ordered it with egg and cheese and didn't get them). To sum it up, this is a good location as far as Burger Kings go, but in the end, it's just Burger King, which is never really all that great.", "type": "review", "business_id": "7_w9XmNhl_l0N3jN3F-qTQ"}

I bitched and moaned after calling Sunday and Monday (yesterday) only to not reach ANYONE. Come to find out, they are closed both days and I somehow neglected to see that when I looked up their hours online. Yes, I am an airhead. I do think it is annoying that their voicemail directs you to their website for hours, though. Anyways, one of the girls actually responded to my voicemail and called me back today to schedule an appt. Seriously? Someone actually called back? Major kudos in my book and then they were able to take me in this afternoon/evening which made me very happy. I was almost 15 minutes late to my appt because the address on my gift certificate was their old location so be aware that they are at Central and south of Virginia, NOT closer to Indian School. The girl working on my hair was Miranda. I opted for the shampoo, cut, and style ($60). If I recall correctly, they do a scalp massage with every haircut and Miranda also gave me a hand massage but I don't remember if that is also with the cut or part of the shampoo. I had Miranda trim my hair, clean up my layers and blow-dry my hair straight (I have curly hair). My hair looks amazing and is silky soft. Yes, I could be in a hair commercial right now with my hair bouncing around my face. I thought Miranda was great and we had good conversation. I thought, whoah she could actually be my friend! She must have wooed me with her stylist charms. No, but seriously, this place was very chill, employees seemed happy to work there and very welcoming of the customers. I guess $60 may seem expensive to some but I felt like you got alot for it. I couldn't do this every month but could be persuaded to visit IDE Mania every 3 months. That seems more reasonable right???? What was cool, too, was that they let me use the remaining $5 on the gift certificate towards Miranda's tip so I gave the rest in cash. The parking situation could be a little awkward but I didn't have any issues. I haven't really been to any other salons (for hair) but as far as I'm concerned, I don't need to.

A new BBQ opened by Kevin Sousa.  A Barbecue and Fired Chicken restaurant.  Nice place with wood planks on the walls and 4 large wooden communal tables.   Cool lighting.  Your meal is served on aluminum trays.   \n\nThe menu has BBQ Chicken, Pork Shoulder, Brisket, St. Louis Ribs.  Sides of Corn Bread, Greens, Mac & Cheese, and Cole Slaw.    Drinks include Rock and Rye - drinks made with Old Overholt Rye,  XXX are other bourbons, Draft beer - 4 from East End, and Pop - including Cheerwine (a southern delicacy) Sprecher's Root Beer, Mexican Coke and others.\n\nThe Pork Shoulder was very tasty and it came with 2 small rolls.  Two sauces - a vinegar based hotter sauce with some hot peppers in the bottom of the bottle - very good and a sweeter sauce that was tomato based.  The sweet sauce was OK but I thought a little to sweet, but then again, I'm not a sweet sauce type.   The Mac & Cheese was good and it comes in a little bowl that is put in the oven/broiler so the top gets a little crusty.  Someone with us had the greens which have some bacon included and said they love the flavor. \n\nType of place you should come with a group and try different meals so you really get the communal flavor.   The table behind us was doing that.  They knew someone in the kitchen that brought out a few samples of other food items to try.  Yum!\n\nSo all of you BBQ fans out there, here is a new opportunity.  Come get some.\n\nCurrently open for dinner, lunch coming soon, I was told.  A couple of people were getting take out.  So stop by.  Have a Rye.  Get take out.\n\nPS:  It is a little dark inside at night.  The communal tables are unique because the set up like a typical BBQ place with picnic type tables, but the benches are set for  two/three  on a side,  3 if you are small per side, so you can have a 4 top and then there is space between the benches, so it is similar to many restaurants  with tables lined up along on side next to each other  with a little space between the benches but the table is connected, so you are not sitting directly next to someone you do not know.

On the drive home it was decided that tacos and guacamole from Chipotle could be a quick & easy dinner, but as we passed by the newly opened (1 month ago?) Grimaldi's in Boca Park, we made a last-minute decision to give their pizza a spin.\n\nWe order a small house salad ($5) and it is large enough to feed 3-4 people, so the two of us have plenty of green to eat. The house vinaigrette is not very vinegary, but the tomatoes and mushrooms are fresh and the whole green olives are good quality. We order a large, traditional Grimaldi's pizza with onions, garlic and jalape\u00f1os ($15 + $2 per topping = $21). As we wait for our pizza, a quick survey of the pizzas on other customers' tables make me a little nervous that the coal-brick-oven at Grimaldi's is over-baking their crust. Every pizza I see in the restaurant has dark-brown/black burnt crust edges. (Thinking that it will take a really resilient dough recipe to withstand that level of scorching, I will be very impressed if their crust is actually chewy/crispy!)\n\nOur pizza shows up. The cheese looks great - it has that stark white color of good Buffalo mozzarella. Bonus fresh basil in the middle of the pizza! No visible grease puddles on or under pizza! Overall the topping quantity isn't terribly generous, but compared to Settebello's 'authentic' (i.e. totally skimpy) pizza topping distribution, I find no reason to complain. With the first bite of any thin crust pizza, I pray to the pizza gods that the crust will be perfectly 50% crispy and 50% chewy. Unfortunately, Grimaldi's crust is 80% crispy and 20% chewy, and by the time the pizza is half eaten (4 slices left) it stales and becomes 100% crispy, much like the crust texture of a Tombstone frozen pizza. How did this happen?!\n\nThe edge of the crust is unacceptably crunchy and flavorless (and burnt!) and the second half of the pizza left me wondering what went wrong with this pizza - how does a pizza crust take a total turn for the worse after only 10 minutes into a meal? We could have easily left 2 pieces for a togo box for next-day's lunch, but found ourselves in a better-eat-it-now-because-it-will-get-stale situation as the crust was already surprisingly stiff. I actually heard the crust *snap* all way down the middle when folding the last slice! \n\nMy favorite pizza experiences in North America have included a few special pies at Lou Malnati's (Chicago), Pizzeria Bianco (Phoenix), John's Pizzeria (NYC), Frank Pepe's (New Haven) and Pizzeria Rustica (Miami). In Vegas I have had good luck at Metro Pizza and at Rocco's NY Pizzeria, and the pear/gorgonzola/arugula/proscuitto pizza at the Sammy's location on Sahara is a consistently tasty choice. With respect to Grimaldi's, I could say \"maybe we got a bad pie\" but judging from the dozen other over-baked pizzas I saw on customers' tables, I think a baking-time or yeast adjustment could really help - the flavor is all there - the crust just needs a little chewy tweaking! Service is friendly and very attentive. Apparently, the cheesecake at Grimaldi's is homemade and as good as NYC Stage Deli's...", "type": "review", "business_id": "MhgYfihkb1QZfVpSNLb2uA"}

The price tag was a little on the high side, but I was in the mood for Thai and have been wanting to try this place for a long time. I ordered the crispy thai rolls, spicy seafood soup hot pot, cashew chicken and the lemongrass & eggplant chicken. \n\nThe thai rolls were a little too sweet (I like to leave that task to the sweet chili paste, but because it was already so sweet, I couldn't even add that to it).\n\nThe spicy seafood soup was EXCELLENT! We really enjoyed the flavor of the broth and the wide variety of morsels in it. I would go back for this one.\n\nThe cashew chicken was ok, but didn't really have much flavor to it and the sauce tasted quite a bit like the sauce for the lemongrass & eggplant chicken.\n\nI LOVE eggplant. It's one of my favorites, especially in thai food. However, the lemongrass & eggplant chicken wasn't very impressive. The eggplant was undercooked, which pretty much just had me pushing it, what is usually my favorite part, off to the side. \n\nWild Thaiger and Thai Hut will remain my go-to places for the time being.", "type": "review", "business_id": "cInzGnaFZ3EIItvFXl1MvQ"}

My husband and I brought our 2 small children with us and ordered the 2 breakfast entrees, which we planned to share with the kids since they don't eat a lot all at once.\n\n My husband got one of their scrambles and I got the pancakes with the berry topping, which was advertised an additional charge above the pancake cost but still well under the $9.29 maximum per entree. My husband ordered a beer and I ordered a mimosa to go along with our breakfast and we ordered the kids each a chocolate milk.\n\nIt did take a while to receive our meals but that doesn't bother me unless its a completely unreasonable amount of time. What bothered me was once we got the bill and showed the waitress the Groupon, she had counted our kids chocolate milks as the \"drinks\" that went along with the meal and did not apply the berry topping charge as part of my \"meal'! \n\nThe Groupon advertises $16 for up to $48 and change worth of food and drink...our total discount was $2.22 after the $16 paid for the Groupon was considered! The waitress refused to let us separate the chocolate milks from the drinks so that the drinks with alcohol could appropriately be applied to the Groupon.\nThe waitress knew we had a Groupon to begin with and she said NOTHING about how it would be applied. It is unbelievable to me that a business would even think about cheating customers out of a few dollars!! It makes no sense! \n\nNow they have 4 fewer customers and I would not recommend this place to anyone. What matters most to me in a business is that they are honest and that their primary goal is to provide quality service and product to customers and help them get the most for their money.

Despite the sketchy surrounding neighborhood and higher priced rent, it was a nice centralized location that fit my lifestyle at the time. \n\nI will say that the benefit of location is a huge plus for Courtney Village. You are less than 10 minutes from ASU and oldtown Scottsdale. Less than 30 minutes from almost every part of the valley. \n\nAnother benefit is their dog park. A good core group of residents frequent the dog park multiple times a week. They are very friendly and welcoming to new people and all they ask is that your dog not be a total dick. It gives the complex a greater sense of community.\n\nUnfortunately, those are the only two benefits that Courtney Village offers. The apartment office is rude and unresponsive to resident inquiries. They advertise a \"gated\" community, but will let the gates sit broken and open for weeks at a time, giving anyone the ability to enter the complex. They promise a 48-hour maintenance work order fix, but refuse to co-ordinate their maintenance appointments with the resident's schedule. They expect you to let their maintenance guys have carte blanche access to your home without ever meeting them. They are so committed to this 48 hour time frame that if you try to call a work order in with a desired fix date more than 48 hours out, they will tell you that you need to call back closer to the desired date. \n\nAnother issue with the office is that everyone is in \"cover your ass\" mode. Employees are quick to throw others under the bus for misinformation and also will lie to a resident at the drop of a hat. My last rent check took over four weeks to be cashed by the office. I called after two weeks to make sure my payment was applied. The office assured me that they had cashed the check and that it must be a problem with my bank. Sure enough, once my check was cashed and I looked at the deposit date, it was deposited on the 27th of the month. Maybe instead of lying to a resident, they could just admit that they fucked up instead of leading someone on a wild goose chase with their bank over outstanding checks.\n\nThe biggest problem is that Courtney Village believes they have some sort of inflated value based on their apartment's location. They will try to charge you almost $900 a month for a 2 bedroom, 1,050sq ft apartment. They do this despite having a trailer park a block to the west, being 1/4th of a mile away from a complex where two men broke into the apartment of a woman and proceeded to rape and rob her, and also 1/4th of a mile away from a National Guard base where a solider was stabbed while taking out the trash. They refuse to even hire a security guard to do nightly checks, instead relying on the two residents who are Phoenix police members to demonstrate a level of security in the complex that does not exist. Seems like the more the neighborhood goes downhill, the higher they raise their rates. They also won't give any current residents a fair shake when it comes to renewing their lease. My buddy continued to pay nearly $800 a month for the same model unit that they rented to his neighbors for $750 two weeks earlier. Seems that they would rather risk bringing in new tenants at a slightly higher price point than working with current residents. \n\nThis review may seem negative, and in all honesty it is, but this complex is ran by a very negative group of people. They try to work you with their community bullshit, but at the end of the day they could care less if your car is broken into or if the grounds look nice or if your apartment is taken care of. They only care about that rent check being dropped in their mail on the 1st. Avoid the bullshit and find a nicer, safer, cleaner place closer to Scottsdale or ASU for the same price point.", "type": "review", "business_id": "bVRoCoXu2jIyqbZRT_isWw"}

You can look\"\n\nI didn't feel like looking so got my outfit with my student discount and headed to banana republic for some assistance in more 'business casual' clothes. \n\nSince they have such a small selection I have found that picking out clothes online (mostly dresses), then going to the store to order them on their red phone works best. I can get the perfect outfit, not have to deal much with the snobby people working there, and get a 15% discount and free shipping.", "type": "review", "business_id": "eYs6QM0CpOQDS4TuIh6tlA"}

The food is hit and miss and more miss than not.  I have been coming here since they opened only because it is convenient to go from my office.  Beer selection is great, but the servers know almost nothing.  Ask them what  Lagers they have on draft and most of the time they stare at you wondering what a lager is.  A major pet peeve of mine is their hush puppies. ALWAYS soggy as if they had been sitting for hours.  It seems they cook them in giant batches early in the day and let them sit.  Their beef brisket is sometimes tender, but most of the time it is hard and dry, again, evidently sat there for hours in the open.  The chilly is offensive - my friend said it felt like spackle.  \nSome things I've had better luck with. Their deviled eggs are always great and so is their pulled pork.

The setting isn't very formal and there's an outdoor seating area with ceiling fans and shade for those that want to hang outside. \n\nWe changed things up by ordering the calamari (fritto misto). A good choice as there was shrimp/calamari and green peppers which brought it some heat. I looked back at my previous review and my significant other ordered the same thing as he did last year. The Brasato Barolo (short ribs) which is a definitely a MUST try... very flavorful, melts in your mouth deliciousness. I decided to get the rack of lamb which was good, nothing extraordinary....a lil bit over done for the \"medium\" that it was supposed to be but I think I could pass it up next time. The best dish of the night was Antonio's Pasta. It was cooked in the glass jar shown in pictures with scallops, shrimp and the best fresh pasta ever! The flavors were just wonderful and I could have just had that for dinner and been content. We ended it with a wonderful chocolate souffle that wasn't overly sweet and paired well with the dolce latte flavored gelato. They also surprised us with a plate of truffles and a Happy Anniversary written on it....sweet touch to a great night.\n\nVerandah's service has always been and still is attentive. Delicious food paired with great service makes it for a great night. They also know how to make a lemon drop martini like how this gal likes it....bonus points there since I've been highly dissatisfied with a lot of lemon drop martinis at other venues. I definitely will be back for more short ribs, etc.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Z1KDov5DRTG-rYF_6TyO1A"}

I'm so glad, since there were so many other choices on the strip and especially after having to cancel our other steakhouse reservation.  We were staying at the Venetian and the place was only 1 mile off the strip, which was not bad of a walk since the weather was so great.  We waited at the bar for the rest of our group to arrive and ordered some drinks.  The pineapple infused vodka was tasty, which they ferment themselves in small glass jars.  \n\nThe bread & butter to start was really good.  But I had to stop myself, since I wanted to save room for the main event.  The Steak Tartare was also very good, probably better then most places I've had it.  The melty steak, lemon juice, and the crisp crostini all went together so well.  Next came out the steaks: the reason we came here.  I ordered the Double Eagle Bone In Strip with a side of Truffle Butter.  Once I heard \"Truffle Butter\", I didn't even hear the other few sauce choices.  I cut into my steak, upon the server's request, and it was cooked perfectly at a medium rare. Juicy, beefy, and truffle buttery steak... it was flavor country.  The Lobster Mac & Cheese side was creamy delicious and the cheesey bacon Potatoes Au Gratin were also very good.  I was tired anymore and was just happy.  One of my friends ordered roasted chicken, which he said was \"phenomenal\".  We also had a vegetarian in the group, so I was happy he was able to custom order a pasta.  They also offered an option to order larger portions of 3 sides.\n\nFrom the bartender to both of our servers, the service was great.  We all had a fantastic meal and was the perfect last dinner of our trip.  It makes me sad in the pants that there isn't a Del Frisco's in Chicago.\n\nAlso, be sure to ask to check out the Bond Table before you leave.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Z0kyK8wCBNGkkUT9UrMWcg"}

AVOID!!!!\n\nI got my carpet installed one year ago on June 15th.  After a year of having the carpet I had it cleaned today professionally.  I had known that the new carpet showed some wear and tear to it already (and I haven't been pleased) but after talking to the carpet cleaner today- I have to voice my opinion!!!\n\nMy husband and I were both first time home-buyers and upon moving into our new house we needed new carpet- pronto.  We had looked around at Home Depot and Lowe's but because of the commercials I wanted to try out Empire.\n\nOur first mistake was not getting estimates from other companies.  When the sales person got to our house (BOB BLANKENSHIP) he was pretty pushy and made it really difficult for both my husband and myself to politely say that we needed to get more estimates.  I knew that I wanted to get more quotes when the dude said that it would cost us $2,500 to carpet three bedrooms (2 rooms are 9'10\" x 9\"10\" while our master is 16' x 13').  I had never bought carpet before but I was pretty sure that three rooms would run us somewhere around $1,000.  Mistake #2 was not kicking the salesman out the front door for being pushy and obnoxious. \n\nBOB BLANKENSHIP did his part by bad-mouthing the competition instead of selling how great their product is (because it's CRAP!) but my hubs and I thought that we were paying for quality.\n\nWe have four cats and wanted something that was extremely stain resistant and would be able to withstand a cat scratch here and there.  We are VERY tidy people.  We leave the doors closed when we aren't in the rooms, I vacuum every 5-6 days, we spot clean the SECOND something hits the carpet, and we never wear shoes or go barefoot (because we were told the oils from our feet would dirty it up).  Plus, it's just the two of us- no children.  Our carpet should be IMMACULATE- BUT IT'S NOT!!!!!\n\nI am SO PISSED at the quality of our carpet. The carpet cleaner that was here today said that he assumed our carpet was 5 years old!!!

They followed up with an email, basically saying they were sorry. They even had the store manager call me. You know what he did? He said he was sorry. Are you kidding me? I'd at least expect a GC to come back. Nope. I'll never go back. It's overpriced crap. At least at Pei Wei it's cheaper and you get your food hot.\n\nHere's my letter to corporate: Hello, I'm writing in regard to the dinner we just had at your Happy Valley location. I'm extremely sorry to say it was very disappointing. When we arrived at our table there were used napkins under the table, and the wrapped silverware I was supposed to use was on the seat of the booth. I asked for a different napkin roll (who wants to use a napkin on your face where people have sat?), so the server gave me one from a different table where he placed the one I didn't want. The food was ok. It tasted ok, but it was not very warm at all. I ordered the mu shu chicken, which I asked for the server to wrap in the crepes me. I understand they are not the most simple to wrap, but by the time they got done with them they looked pretty unappetizing. They were ripped and pretty rough looking. I would have told the server or anybody that our food wasn't very hot, but nobody ever came back to the table to ask us how everything was. I also was only drinking water because I'm pregnant and avoiding caffeine and alcohol. It would have been nice to have been offered more water at some point. It's disappointing to me, because we only try to eat out once a week lately to help save money. We thought we'd treat ourselves to a nice afternoon movie and then a nice dinner out. I selected your restaurant because I thought of it as more mid-upper scale. So, I thought it would be a nice treat for my partner and myself. Nobody ever came back to ask how things were. When I asked the server for to-go boxes he suggested I \"take care of it myself.\" Basically, he'd already cleared everything away, so I had to put the mu shu chicken roll in the box myself with my hands. I felt this was sort of weird and inappropriate. I mean, better my hands than his, but it's not what I'd call a nice dining experience. Our server was just ok, but it did seem like we weren't that important to him - but maybe that's how he feels if you don't order drinks and apps - if he's assuming you aren't going to tip him very well. I always tip at least 20%, if not more, when the service is good. He was lucky to get 15%. He was fair at best. I found all of this very surprising because the restaurant was maybe a third full - so it's not like they were so slammed that things slipped by. The other sad thing is that we spent a good part of our dining conversation talking about where we should have gone for better Chinese food and service. Then when we left my partner kept commenting on how Applebee's, Logan's or Ah-So would have been better. Perhaps it would have. I noticed on my receipt a message saying I could take a survey if I had a code. I had no code or I would have gladly taken the survey with this feedback. I also noticed the staff trying to seat a couple at a booth where two young children had previously been. The booth was messy and had food on the seat, and the older gentleman had to point it out to the server asking her to clean it before he sat down. There were plenty of open tables, yet she was sitting them next to the kitchen at a dirty table. In fact, she was wiping the table as she sat them down - in a restaurant that was a third full! I hope your staff is able to correct some of this obvious issues. During what continues to be tough economic times, I think people are much more selective about their dining-out dollars. I know that's our case. I would be very hesitant to return to any of your locations after this dinner.", "type": "review", "business_id": "lut0g04VsYRyblR1Ad-8HA"}

I must add though that the main reason we went was because the Travel Channel did a list of the world's weirdest bathrooms, and the bathrooms at the library came in second on the list. I know what you're saying too yourselves. That could be the lamest reason to visit someplace! Now that I think about it, you are probably right.\n\nThe 1 star is for the bathrooms. The actual library gets 3 stars, because although the building is stunning, I found the inside to be disorganized and a bit dirty. Back to the bathrooms though. We went into the bathrooms and there was nothing weird about it. So we decided to ask the librarian what made it weird and he did not know what we were talking about. He then told us that if you look into a little hole in the wall dividing the entryways into the men's and women's bathrooms, you can see light from the fiber optics installed in the library. He then said it's probably cool for only about a second and that it definitely was not weird. \nAnd guess what? He was absolutely spot on.\n\nNow I don't know who to blame. Should I blame the library for installing something so dumb? Should I blame the travel channel for putting this on the world's weirdest bathrooms, or frankly creating a list of the world's weirdest bathrooms? Or should I blame myself for going to a library to see this in the first place? Ah heck, I'll blame all three.", "type": "review", "business_id": "K04Sot5bwUk-BkOotkurmA"}

I was hoping they would bring the Vietnamese coffee strainer and all. I wasn't impressed with the coffee. It didn't taste fresh. I suspect they brewed a big batch and mixed it up with condensed milk and refrigerated. It tasted like a stale coffee with crushed ice. The service was friendly and polite though. The lady took my order within quick minute I sat myself down.  However, it took them half an hour to serve the soup and the egg rolls considering the place wasn't busy/packed on a Sunday afternoon. I didn't complain for the long wait as I was watching the bus girl as she cleared, cleaned and sanitized the tables, and the older guy (maybe the owner) admonishing the cashier while he ate his lunch of rice noodles with sriracha and hoisin sauce and broth on the side.\n\nMy soup arrived, suprisingly, lukewarm. They were a bit stingy with their fresh herbs and bean sprouts. The herbs for my pho didn't come with \"culantro\", the jagged elongated green leaf. Even the herb accompaniment to my cha gio was lacking slices of cucumber, and had only 5 sticks each of pickled daikon and carrots, and just one lettuce leaf for 4 rolls. The accompanying nuoc cham was very watery, and to say the least, bland. I had to add a teaspoon of chili paste oil for extra kick. Though the soup came lukewarm, the broth was good.  It was beefy and rich but I didn't taste the subtle presence of star anise, cardamom and cinnamon.  I had to add a teaspoon of sambal olek and few drops of nam pla  and a drizzle of hoisin sauce to make it somewhat close to the broth I've tried and savored in the streets of Ho Chi Minh City.   Pho Saigon's was/is not as good as Los Angeles' Pho So 1, Seattle's Pho Bac, or Denver's Pho 79 or Fredericksburg, Virginia's South Vietnam House .

I didn't taste the presence of the ground pork skin or the rat's ear mushrooms. To me, personally, it didn't taste like a Vietnamese cha gio. It tasted more, and if it was skinnier and longer, like Filipino lumpia.\nThis is my first venture to Pho Saigon and though I wasn't that impressed, I am, for sure, going back for another try.", "type": "review", "business_id": "sXkkxz7FwWx9ayHbDx0LbQ"}

I am from Boston, and have been to Maine many times, so you can't expect to get cheap lobster in Charlotte, NC. The steaks are good-to be expected, but I was surprised at how delicious the cheeseburger was. I am a big cheeseburger fanatic and the meat is very supple and quality.

I was late in getting us going so I hurried inside and clicked on the Google Maps directions which sent us 20 minutes in the wrong direction.  This was fateful because when we arrived for Lunch, the salad bar was closing in a few minutes so my wife and daughters felt a bit rushed through their meals (they opted to skip on the barbeque).  Still, there was a lot of variety for lunch and they ended up filling up some extra plates and bringing them back to the table.  My son and I made a single pass through the salad, trying most of everything.  It was all very tasty.  Then the meat started coming out!  My son and I had at least six servings of everything.  Despite there being fewer selections at dinner, the meat was quite tasty (although my son commented later that it was a bit greasy for his taste.)  We ordered the Chocolate Mousse cake for dessert but they also brought a separate dessert for me, the birthday boy!  By the time we rolled out of there, I didn't need to eat until the next day!  Lunch was a great idea to save a little on money and avoid some of the crowds; just remember to get there well before 3:00 when they switch from Lunch to the Dinner buffet to avoid getting charged more.  Also, I tried the caipirinha and it was very tasty (had a similar taste to a margarita on the rocks, but better.)  All five of us ate for less than $100 so it was a pretty good experience.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SbS0XQG39VgP6L6wbZ56RA"}

Our waiter was very kind, didn't try to rush us, and gave us plenty of time to decide. \n\nWe had a house salad, dirty chips, and an order of sliders.

The sliders were average, and well priced.\n\nI really want to go back and try a happy hour sometime to try more of the small plates, our only regret was that the order of dirty chips was BIG, we could only finish half of it.

The service was 5 out of 5.  The food was good and I would give it 3 out of 5.\n\nWe arrived for our reservations and were seated after a short delay.  When we arrived the wait list was 2 hours long so make sure to make a reservation.\n\nWe started off with the shrimp cocktail.  These were some of the biggest shrimp I have seen on a cocktail.  We were served 4 shrimp.  We were not told the size but they looked like they may have been U-8's (more likely U-16's but they were huge).  They were served with two sauces both of which were excellent.\n\nOut next course was a wedge salad.  Their wedge salad consists of three separate salads: a traditional wedge, a wedge with fried pepperoncini, and one with nuts and a dark dressing.  All three salads were pretty good.  \n\nFor our main courses we opted for an 18oz bone in ribeye and an 8 oz fillet, both cooked rare.  The side was the mash of the day (lobster mash potatoes).  The side was excellent.  Both steaks were pretty good.  The ribeye was overcooked and came out medium rare.  The filet was cooked properly but was a little tough.   \n\nNOTE: The menu states \"Our steaks and prime rib are upper 2/3 choice Angus beef\".  This means they serve the top 1/3 of Choice beef.  Therefore they are not selling Prime beef but rather good cuts of choice beef.  The difference was noticeable in both steaks.  The Ribeye had larger pockets of fat as oppossed to more spread out marbleing.  The filet was tough for a filet.  The dry age on the Ribeye was excellent.  I really enjoyed the Ribeye and would give it a 7 out of 10.  The filet receives a 4 out of 10 because it was tough.\n\nThe service was really phenomenal the entire meal.  Ken explained everything and was a true pro.\n\nThe meal was reasonably priced for a nice Vegas meal  With that being said, for $40 to $50 a steak they should serve you Prime beef.  \n\n If you use your Tropicana card you can save a few bucks.

Needless to say, after this visit, we will not be returning.\nWe arrived around 5:30ish and the restaurant was only about half full. They were running with two wait staff who seemed to be pretty busy despite the patio being empty. We decided against an appetizer this time but had we, perhaps we would have had something to eat sooner rather than the much later when our food finally came. We kept it simple: I with a chicken schwarma platter (which was tasty) and she with a gyro flatbread. Apparently \"flatbread\" meant a wheat tortilla and not actual flatbread as you'd get if ordered elsewhere. That aside, the food came after a seemingly excessive 30+ minute wait. This is no exaggeration. It seems that the cooks were prioritizing to-go orders over food for the dining room and I'll never understand that. Whatever.\nWhen it did come, hers was COLD. I couldn't stop the waiter (whose name I will spare) to bring it to his attention since he seemed to be covering more than half the dining room area. He didn't ever stop to ask if everything was correct or if everything was okay. NOT ONCE. All through our dinner, my aggravation was clearly present on my face but, despite that, no one ever stopped to bother asking... not even the owner's wife who was seated across the aisle from us and who began helping out a bit once things picked up.\nDespite all this, I remained pleasant with the waiter seeing as perhaps some of the issues were beyond his control. I don't excuse him entirely though seeing as he never came back to check on us beyond filling our drinks once. We also had to ask for our check as did the other couple who was seated in front of us. The server was apparently so busy they walked their check up to the front register. I made sure to fill out the enclosed comment card since it's apparently important enough for them to include it with your check. After filling it out, I made sure to ask the owner's wife if they read and valued the opinions written on them. She smiled and said yes, so I stressed that it was important for her to read mine. I turned and walked out with not a word being uttered from either the wife or the owner (perhaps a male family member?) who had recently come into the restaurant and seemed very enthralled with attending to the three blondes seated back near the bar area. A disappointing end to what could have been a nice visit. Such a shame, too. I really like their food.", "type": "review", "business_id": "9em_vfSjwcPqQgU8Zj-hzA"}

There's a wall for beginners and a 30 foot wall with rocks hanging upside down for the experts who really will scale a mountain in the alps.

I enjoyed looking at their photos on the wall and seeing them in their different elements. For the great outdoors men just using PRG for practice, they have a rock climbing shop upstairs that houses essentials for the outdoor adventure. The staff keeps an active calendar of events including challenges for frequenters of the gym. \n\nWhile I am a scaredy cat when it comes to climbing, they kept me safe and secure as I scaled the wall and tried not to think about plummeting to my death.

Pulled into an empty space. Kept the engine running and air condition blasting. The screen turned out to be the menu, speaker, and ATM all in one. WHAT?!?!?! How innovative.\n\nScanned the menu for items I wanted to order.\n\nPressed the speaker button to alert the assistant inside that I was ready to order. A very pleasant, disembodied voice took my order, then said she'd be out in a few with my order. Ok, let's see how fast . . . \n\nIn the meantime I inserted my credit card to finalize the transaction. Receipt rolled out.\n\nAs promised, within minutes a sweet young lady arrived balancing a red tray loaded with 2 paper bags and a couple of drinks. She confirmed my order according to the receipt printed out on her side, then she handed over my booty.\n\nHanded her a tip and I was on my way with a Sonic burger & fries, classic hot dog with the works, condiments, a limeade and a blue coconut slush and 2 peppermint candies. Yaowzaaaaa!\n\nNo Sonic anywhere near where I live, but when they show up I'll be one of the first in line.

I was excited to have a new pizza place very close to my house, and that serves slices no less! So after a night out with some friends, the husband and I came here to get a couple late night slices. We arrived at the (very cute) pizza place sometime around 9, so not too long after they opened and ordered 3 slices, cheese, pepperoni, and a special (which was a white pizza with asparagus, bacon, and a few other toppings). It smelled good as we took it home. Unfortunately, the slices seemed old, like they'd already been sitting out a lot longer than they possibly could have if they had been made when the store opened. The crust was dry and stiff. The special pizza was especially bad, with a very flavorless white base atop the stiff cardboard like crust... it was not awesome. The cheese was significantly better since their sauce was alright, but still nothing amazing. Maybe their full pies are better (and more fresh), but I don't know that I'd come here for slices again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "51vtDjP79vBjaI5dbkPoPw"}

We left to eat, came back in 1.5 hours and the car still had window smudges and wax build up. We pointed this out and our 9 hour dilemma. They said it wasn't covered in the detail. My car still wasn't done after 8 hours. Wax, smudges, wet carpet, and missed dust. We spent $300 and had a total of 17 hours for 2 cars on a detail reservation a week in advance.

I went with a simple quesadilla - two flour tortilla's with spicy cheese and chicken, grilled into a sandwich sort-of thing. It arrived with small bowls of sour cream, guacamole and salsa. It seemed that the guacamole and the salsa had been prepared elsewhere as they were not as flavorful or fresh as I have had elsewhere.\n\nI opted for a margarita on the rocks, which arrived in a very pretty shaker with plenty of salt on the rim of the glass. The drinks menu cleverly does not have prices, so I was a little surprised that a regular (not top shelf) drink was $8, though there was enough in there for two. Not very strong.\n\nAfter eating, I stayed at my table for another hour waiting for my flight. I had to call over the waitress to clear my dishes, after which I brought out the laptop and signed on to CLT's free wi-fi network.

Since I'm basically an over-grown child, Sweeties is the answer to my prayers!  I checked out past reviews before coming here, and I will agree that you should take a walk around before pulling any delicious candy items off of the shelves.  My heart soared as I took a stroll around the aisles and aisles of beautiful sugar-goods throughout the store.  If I am ever having a bad day; trust me, Sweeties is the spot to be!\n\nI tried to remain conservative with what I picked out during this trip but was surprised at the true variety of candy products!  I found Red Super Rope licorice (my favorite treat of childhood), which in the past I was only able to find online.  I also found Buckeye chocolate candies which I though only existed in Ohio and are melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  There were treats from decades ago as well, which I was not familiar with, but I picked up some items that sounded pretty good as well.  \n\nThe only thing that would have made the trip sweeter would have been if the location was a little closer to my house, or at least closer to the 60 freeway...  It's right around downtown Chandler next to a strip mall and when I walked up I saw a couple breaking into their own car (maybe they left the keys in it?), and I'm not so sure about the neighborhood...  \n\nOverall, it was a success; I will be back soon!", "type": "review", "business_id": "7tPe20uDErh-iSkfNEWzVQ"}

You would never see this place off the road unless you knew where it was.  Its tucked into a residential neighborood which adds to the hominess feel of the place.  The restaurant is a no frills butcher shop, but the smells are enough to get your mouth watering.  I went for the 3 meat combo with ribs, brisket and puled pork with mac and cheese and mac salad for sides.  The ribs were a little dry but the flavor was very good.  The rub was excellent and great smokey flavor, could have just been a bad day.  They offer 2 bbq sauces so I put the spicey sauce on the ribs and they were just fine.  The highlight was the brisket, it was tender and flavorful with no sauce needed.  the third meat was a pulled pork sandwich and it was great, this is one of those dishes that your average joe who isn't totally into bbq would love or kids. \n\n We ordered the hot link sandwich and was surprised to find that it was a hot link on a bun with a side of hot links smothered in bbq sauce and both were excellent!  You get a great sausage flavor up front and then the heat follows up shortly.  \n\nThe Mac and Cheese was the highlight of the trip for reason that most mac and cheese you find at bbq places are bland.

Our room was extremely clean - at one point I ended up on the bathroom floor hunting for a dropped earring, and was completely impressed at how spotless it was.  The staff were very friendly and helpful.  There were no \"gotcha\" items in the rooms (you know the type - \"we've provided this bottle of water for your convenience, break the seal and we'll charge you $10\").  The bed was a bit firm, but plenty comfortable, with nice soft pillows.  The mini-fridge was surprisingly good-sized.\n\nThe continental breakfast deserves its own paragraph - plenty of carbs (bagels, waffles, Danishes, mini-muffins, cereal) but also lots of fresh fruit for the health nuts out there.  Protein was sadly in short supply, but I managed to load up my bagel with cream cheese, and between that and a banana, I felt pretty well served.  Absolutely a cut above most such offerings.\n\nBest of all, the wi-fi was both hassle-free (not even a redirect to a \"Welcome to Best Western, please watch this ad\" page) and well-covered - there were three access points available from our room.  I can't even say how many hotels I've stayed in that could take pointers from them on this matter.\n\nToss in the free parking and leisurely check-out time (noon), and I was seriously impressed - it was a better experience than most three- and three-and-a-half star hotels I've stayed at.

I'm assuming that's because the veterinarian responded asking me to call him directly to get the situation resolved - unfortunately, I attempted that call three times - each time leaving a message with the office staff (Lydia I believe) and shockingly, never got a return call!\n\nI have taken my dogs here for a while and after getting a new kitten, decided to take her there as well to get all of the shots she needed, as well as have her fixed and front declawed. I called the vet on 3 different occasions. Once to find out the cost, the second time because the front desk girl had told me I had to wait until the kitten was 13 weeks old, so I called back then to schedule ... only to find out - oops, she was wrong - it's 16 weeks. SO I waited another 3 weeks and called back, once again confirming the pricing. I was told she would need $40 in shots, the spay would be $65 and the front declaw would be $80. I made my appointment for the very next morning. I got there prior to opening and waited for someone to unlock the door. I walked in, signed in easily and then was put in a room to wait for the doctor. When the doctor came in, we discussed everything and she asked if I was aware of the pricing. That is when I repeated exactly what was told to me for the three services I required. \n\nShe looked shocked and said no that is absolutely not the pricing and she left the room. When she came back she had a print out with her and we went over everything listed. While the amounts I had been told were correct, someone forgot to mention the addtional EIGHTY DOLLARS for a pain block and something else related to the declaw. So the declaw suddenly doubled in price - while I was standing there in the office. I explained to her that no one had given me that information and I thought it was quite a large mess up to just be brushed under the rug. She recommended that I not talk about the cost of any services with the receptionists that answer the phone. She said she was sorry, but I would have to pay it. I took my cat and left. They have now lost my business and my mother's (as she always took her dog there as well). If you cannot accurately share pricing ... you shouldn't be answering the phone.", "type": "review", "business_id": "jNuVT5tobPHEAFTp5clyPw"}

Being that I came from one of the high end luxury apartments in OC, I was seriously concerned I'd end up hatiing it. However, I'm happy to report my experiences here have been great! It's also much more quiet than my last place, which does say alot. When I first walked through the Leasing office doors (over a year ago), this was the last and final place I went to tour. I had to wait a few months to get the unit & location I wanted, but I'm glad I did. The one that was open for move in immediately was right on Rainbow. Though it was tempting to take it, I knew with my sensitivity to noise & privacy I would have regreted it. So long story short, I am very happy here. The only thing I could say is that the craftmanship isn't the greatest here. My place in OC was immpecible in that department. But that's one small thing I am willing to overlook for all the other more important issues to consider living in any apartment. The mainance has also been great. Anytime I've needed them, they are there and take care of things quickly.

I so want to give this place 5 stars!! I love Yama Asian Fusian in South Park and I had really high expectations of their new restaurant. We came not long after they opened with the intent on trying some small bites and getting some ramen.\n\nSmall bites first: \n\nButa Kakuni (pork belly) this was really good. Cooked well but I prefer mine crispier on the outside. This was a little on the soggy side. Just a personal preference though, taste wise it was good!\n\nThe hamachi jalepenos were probably a 3-4/5 stars. I adore yellowtail but this pretty much left me underwhelmed.\n\nGyu Tataki (seared steak) was probably the best thing I ate all night!! Seriously I could eat nothing but a meal of this and some rice... very well seasoned and perfectly cooked.\n\nOkonomiyaki (japanese pancake) I have no idea if this was how it was supposed to taste because I did not like it at all!! My friends said it was pretty good though. \n\nSoba w/Anago minus the anago lol... This was a good dish however we got it about 10-15 minutes after we finished eating. \n\nGyoza was standard\n\nRamen:  I was not impressed. The noodles didn't seem to be cooked properly and were clumping together and not very slurpable (new word lol). The quality and flavor just seemed to be off. It definitely was not enough to get us to come there for ramen versus Musashi's. \n\nOverall I would have given this place 4 stars except the service we had was actually kind of terrible. The guy managing the house was one of the servers from Yama and I remember him well. However he seemed overwhelmed. Again they are new so I was cutting them some slack. We needed a table for 3 and he said it would be a few minute wait for a table to leave and be cleared off so we went to the bar. A table left and no one had cleaned it off but they appeared busy. Another couple came in and a waitress went up to them and attempted to give them the table we were waiting on. At this point we'd been waiting for about 15 minutes staring at an empty dirty table for 10 of those minutes so we were a little peeved. I went up to her and said we've been waiting for that table for 10 minutes. The manager put our names on the list and she just completely ignored it. There were 2 person tables along the wall as well. She got really defensive and kind of nasty with me, again losing points. Our waiter came by eventually and could 100% not be bothered with us. He was not happy to be waiting on us and I think he may have been ill. He would disappear for long long stretches of time and it took FOREVER to get through this meal. About halfway through the meal after he had to go put a few of our items in for order because he forgot I saw him bookbag/takeout bag in hand leaving the restaurant. He never once told us he was leaving or said a word to us. Just left... The guy who took over was nice but clearly had not been updated on the tables. Again our previous waiter had supposedly put the rest of our order in and hadn't. Honestly with the service the way it was I'd give a normal restaurant 1 star... However I know the standards by which their other restaurant runs and I'm hoping this is just new restaurant issues that will be resolved. If I'm in the area I may stop in again for some small bites but will probably skip the ramen.", "type": "review", "business_id": "N3zrgORGPLCnSlMRZTFbCA"}

It's just BULL!!! If their waitstaff were attentive, we wouldn't have to flag someone down to get some service. \n\nSo to the food. It was mediocre at best. The yellow and green curry were bleh. It was more like a soup. The pad thai wasn't as flavorful as I had wanted it to be. It was more on the bland side of the spectrum. The only dish that blew my mind was the Jun Pad Poo. The crab meat was fresh and big chunks at that.\n\nThis was the really bummer here. When you are done eating, you're setting yourself up for a dessert that you expect that a Thai Restaurant should have. SERIOUSLY! NO MANGO WITH STICKY RICE? wait wait . . . NO FRIED BANANA WITH ICE CREAM? WTFH!!! The server's response was \" We don't have mango with sticky rice. Oh we don't have fried banana with ice cream either. It's not in season right now so we don't have it.\" Everyone at our table thought . . . \"ARE YOU F-ing SERIOUS?\" So we decided to go even further and asked \"So what do you have?\" The response was, \"Oh we have just plain ice cream and roti\". To our disappointment, we just asked for the check so we can leave. \n\nOverall, since they had a cheap lunch special. It was a cheap bargain. I'll be a little on the positive side and give them a 2 star. 1 got the nice decor of the place. 2 for the cheap lunch deal.\n\nMy advice is to test this place out during the lunch hour so you don't get charged more for something that you would've gotten for less. Who is to say, right? They might have something super good that will blow your mind, but so far for me, nothing stood out for me.", "type": "review", "business_id": "VAeiLMTICw2CSFpy28CsWQ"}

We chose to do our dinner family style and we shared a meat for two, a meat for one, two pasta dishes, and a side. Perfect amount of food, no one was too full after the meal, but everyone had had just enough. The food was delicious. The pasta dishes were definitely homemade and the steaks were wonderful, cooked well and melted in your mouth. Yes, this was an expensive dinner, but we all felt it was well worth it. Our service was great (though should have been because there were few besides us there for 5:00 dinner). No complaints.

The resturant is situated in the Old John Carson Hotel.  You have to look for it. The name is located on the lower part of the window in black letters, hard to distiguish with the glare from the sun. We entered  Carson's K and there were a few people there and it was nice a quiet. The place is nicely decorated and we like the mixture of woods, metal and tile work. The kitchen is open which I liked but the tables are mostly big tables that I assume you would share with other people you do not know if your party is only two people. That would not be so bad if the stools were not so close together. I am have wide shoulders and so does my partner and to be honest, it is not comfortable if you are paying for an experience.  I like experiences but not if I am being intruded by people who are sitting right on top of me.\n \nWe sat in at a table across from the bar with a view of the old Post Office. We were immediately greeted by our server who was friendly and listed all of the foods that we had questions about. She took our drink order and after some time we ate our first choice,  the Crispy Chicken skins......Ok, we normally do not eat skin, but this was pure heaven. They were crisp and perfectly seasoned. I like the honey sauce that came along with it.\n \nA short time later, our orders arrived:  me the Fried Green Tomato with lump crab ravigote. It was great. I wish there more tomatoes on it. The tomatoes were lightly breaded and fried.  PERFECT!!!!  Kerry, tell the cooks to put more on there. The tator tots were crispy and fresh and not as greasy as I thought they would be.\n \nMy other half had the Butter Burger with boursin and chedder. The cheese was a little too heady (spelling?) and it did not taste so hot. The burger itself was good. It was not dry and had a great flavor to it. My partner ate it all up after scraping the cheeses off.\n \nOur services was good, not great.  Our drinks were never refilled or were we asked if we wanted more to drink....bad!!!  When I go out, I want service, not half hearted, come on strong them leave me waiting. That is not a way to win a repeat. Aside from that, everything else was good. I am not sure if we will be back. The place is small and I can not imagine how crowded it must get at night.  I wonder why they did not build a larger space.\n \nFOOD:                A\nATMOSPHERE: A\nSERVICE:          C\nPRICE:               B the portions are enough if you are starving.", "type": "review", "business_id": "sih8j621A66QoiUFues5qQ"}

Amore changed my pizza loving ways forever. So--dear eaters--I sincerely apologize for not listening to you Chicago deep dish lovers.  I was so wrong.\n\nAmore is one of those pizza joints that you pass by while driving home, but never take the time to stop in.  Since I'm a bit adventurous at the moment, I decided to cancel my mail order deep dish from Chicago (from Lou Malnati's) and take my mother here for some Italian.  There are two reasons I chose this place out of all places in Vegas - 1) the reviews are oustanding, and 2) the chicago deep dish pizza.  \n\nWhen you first walk in, you see a casual eatery; the usual metal chairs and chicago-dressed 4 top tables fill the seating area.  There's sports memorabilia on counters, and posters on walls. But forget the decor--the scent of cheese and pasta should get you excited when you walk in the door.\n\nThe staff is friendly and will tell you what is best when you ask.  I trust the staffers, since they eat the food for lunch daily.  The consensus? - Ribs, deep dish, and lasagna.  The girls say that the ingredients are from home (Chicago), so it tastes just as good, if not better.  It takes 45 minutes for a deep dish'er, but trust me--it is worth the wait.\n\nThe appetizer list is short and sweet.  We went for the usual fare--some breaded mushrooms with ranch dressing.  Their breading is well seasoned, crispy and isn't oily at all.  There were no grease stains on the plate even after sitting for a few minutes.  The lasagna is creamy, layered with sliced sausage and ricotta and dressed with a fresh tomato sauce that is so darn good.  I like the sliced sausage or meatballs in the lasagna and LOVE the cheesiness.  The sauce, with it's tangy kick balances the sausage and  cheese out well.  The ribs are melt-in-your-mouth tender and they aren't slathered in sauce, which I appreciate.  It's sweet and smoky with a bit of spice and tang.  Served with lots of fries and some beans, it's a big boy dinner.\n\nThe star of the night was the deep dish pie we ordered.  The first time I laid my eyes on it I was excited to see the crust uneven.  The sauce is fresh and the cheese, decadent.  The first slice came up with the spatula followed by a strings of cheese, almost endless as I placed the first slice on my plate.  This is not your pick up and eat pizza; this requires a fork and knife.  The crust is flaky and buttery, well seasoned and so much fun to eat.  The cheese is creamy and unending, the sauce tangy but sweet, and the pepperoni crispy and gives just the right amount of saltiness to the dish.  The best part--the spicy kick in their sauce.  It's subtle, but there.  I ate half the pie, savored every bit of the crust, and wiped my plate with it to catch all the leftover cheese and gobs of sauce.  I did it all in complete silence and focus, mind you, finally coming up to breathe once I had my fill.  \n\nThis joint is a great stop on anyone's Yelp to-try list. I have to admit that I wasn't thrilled at first to try a deep dish pizza, but once I saw it was love at first sight, and marriage by the first bite.  You cannot beat great pizza, let alone great deep dish, and this place takes the pie.", "type": "review", "business_id": "6X01fXVzhCght4ZJ9Ei2JQ"}

Location -  5 Star - If you live in this area, it is great. Huge parking spaces, great restaurants like Jun's Korean and Lemongrass Pho Noodles!  Oddly, the Roundtable here closed. Easy access to freeway and all streets!  Never too crowded.\n\nb.  Service - 2 Star - I would say based on the results of the service, I would say that their goal is to have great service, but management does not set a quality standard.  For a weekday matinee, what possible reason is there to have only one line open when about 10 people are waiting in the 100+ weather to buy tickets?  Then, the air/con inside the ticket room is so powerful that it pushes money and tickets around at the little hole they use to interact with the clients?  At the concessions, why are there about at least 6-7 cashier/ordering spots and only 1-2 open? What would cause you to have a line of 12-15 and not open another cashier???\n\nc.  Stuff - 4 Star - OK, like all places all the normal food. I do like the fact that the large popcorn is in a tub and not a bag. Free refils on large popcorn and soda.  That is a pretty good deal.\n\nd.  Theater - 3 Star - If you are lucky to have a movie in one of their large auditoriums, you get a great cinematic experience. Unfortunately if you get one of the small auditoriums, you get a rinky dink theater screen and it is a just average experience.  The facility is old and getting wornout. It is due for some kind of basic upgrade. Why not let you roam through the lobby and order food while someone else is ordering the tickets? Here you have to use your tickets before you get to the food area. Not efficient\n\ne.  Prices - 4 Star - Now I don't remember, but on Tuesdays they have a great deal on movies and their other prices are similar to everywhere.\n\nOverall , 3 Star - this is a tired place and if you want to full experience, I would say that AMC 16 (rave) is the place to go and perhaps Brendan Theaters.  \n\nI like coming here for a quick movie, but otherwise, I like AMC 16.", "type": "review", "business_id": "i14bgR6hVw36EkNG_Ct8Eg"}

They seamstress works in house, I think she may even own the shop. (Don't quote me on that) And she was amazing, everything was perfection, and affordable. Sweetest lady ever. She carefully walked me and one of my Maid's through getting my dress on and off, and what needed to be done to the dress after the wedding.\n\n3. I made payments on my dress from day one. They REALLY worked with me. I am making my last payment soon. (Usually you pay in full after your second fitting but they were completely willing to work with me and pay my last payment after my second and final fitting.)\n\n4. From answering the phone, to being in the store. Any person I have talked to that worked there, has ALWAYS been friendly to me. Great customer service.\n\n5. They do not try to push you to buy anything. They are just there to help you.\n\n6.Sqeeky clean and stylish store. In and out. \n\nI feel like I could go on and on. And I just might after my wedding day. I really cant wait to share my pictures of my dress.", "type": "review", "business_id": "CrgxZ5nshQ1KPm3IQ11Z2A"}

She wound up getting an Odell's (another CO microbrewery), which was good....but was very disappointed.\n\nb) The menu had some intense mis-spellings, things that if they'd ran a spell check, they would have fixed. Like vegitarian. As a marketing person, errors like that always annoy me. Nit-picky? Yes. But that's how I am.\n\nc) Our first waiter made this whole deal about how he was going off shift to drink with his friends, and would have someone else take care of us, and bid us farewell. And then came back not, once, but twice. A little odd.\n\nd) The bathrooms were a bit gross, and the ads expired in 2008?\n\nHowever, the food was delicious. Our server Lindsay was new, so she had to check on a few things, but was friendly, timely, and made us feel very welcome.

When we tried to flag down a server, he rudely snapped \"just wait a minute\" and walked away. Then he went to 3 different tables, checked on them, and brought them things.

Both times I've been to this club, I leave just after midnight after the free drinks are over. \nThe first time I went, it was 2 guys and 2 girls. All of us got in right away, didnt have to wait in line, and the girls got in free. Unfortunately, the guys had to pay still. Once we got in, the free drink ladies had us sign something to get our drink tickets. After that, it was over. I jump on free drinks like no other! They give you two drink tickets at a time, but the bartenders only allow you to get one drink at a time. Simple solution - get one drink at one bartender, move down a little and get the second drink from another. duuhh. Passed the drinks on to the guys, and went back to get more tickets. I cant even tell you how many times we went back and forth for our free drinks, but I can tell you that at the end of the night, 3 of the 4 in our group were sh*tfaced. \nThe music was ok. The dance floor in the main room, as far as I can tell since I never actually got to the dancefloor, is pretty small. They have strip poles around the place for the ladies to enjoy making fools of themselves.

It was still in preview mode when we went, so I'm exercising forgiveness. It definitely has some serious 5-star potential, though.\n\nFirst off, it is definitely an experience, not a museum or exhibit. At the start, you basically walk through being a low-level mob person. I don't want to give away too much, but it is kinda neat and fun. You basically interact with a bunch of staff that play different characters.\n\nAt several points throughout the journey, you are guided / given overviews and intros by a video image of James Caan, which was pretty neat.\n\nPart of the experience is more museum-ish with several galleries profiling the mob in Vegas, different individual mobsters, and Hollywood and the mob. It was all eh. The best part was the lengthy video about the making of The Godfather.\n\nLikes:\n-The \"experience\" aspect (though, it does need some work)\n-The emphasis throughout on Vegas and the mob\n-That the info was all on video screens, not small plaques\n-The overall set-up and props\n\nDislikes:\n-Some of the actors were pretty bad\n-The pictures they take of you, in typical Vegas fashion, are $20\n-No locals discount\n-It seems a little overpriced ($30 during preview, $40 once it officially opens)\n-A lot of the video screens weren't working\n-The timing of everything was off\n-It overall seemed unfinished\n\nAgain, definitely has 5 star potential and there are still a lot of kinks they need to work out.

Most tourists and locals alike will tell you about \"the time I went to the double down\" like \"the time I went skydiving.\" It was on a To-do list, and they did it, with no need or reason to repeat.\nFor others it's one of the last great tributes to a town, in which, you can get away with almost anything. \nThere are very few dive bars, which can create such a prolific legend with so much hype, and still maintain its impossibly grungy dive roots. In my opinion this place still holds the title, but doesn't get credit it deserves. It's like the band that has blown up and so therefore can no longer be cool because they are now on the radio.\n\nYou are of course free to order whatever you want when you go, but if you are going just for the sake of saying you did then you must order the combo...A shot of ass juice and a schlitz for $5 and the famous bacon martini for $6. The bacon martini is no joke. It is strips of bacon in a bottle of vodka, and it tastes exactly like it, with a visible oily shine to go with it.\nThere are TV's featuring crazy videos in the back ground, lots of seating, pool table, and numerous murals and paintings in every corner, the content of most resembles what you would get if Picasso and Rob Zombie co-illustrated a comic strip. \n\nBut here is the kicker...the service is amazing! During the 2 hours I was last there the bartender 3 times replaced our empties without asking as we finished our last sip. My friend pulled a cigarette out, when the bartender, was suddenly standing in front of us, arm extended with a lit lighter in hand. After she lit up, she gave a bemused smile and \"Thank you\" which received a prompt head nod, then back to the craft. We in no way give off a punk rock vibe and were somewhat dressed up, But in no way did we get the feeling we were out of our element. Let me just say that there are a lot of places in Vegas that could learn a lesson from Double Down.\n\nLive music and they never charge a cover. My only negative is that it's very punk rock oriented, which is great for when i'm in the mood for it, or if you are a huge punk fan, but can be a deterrent if I want a wider variety while i'm out.", "type": "review", "business_id": "t1sCvl0nSbWeRj0ZgsolRA"}

We have always felt apart of the process. Never has a single course been bad. We have stolen several of their ideas and used them in our own kitchen. The chefs are open to discuss where they shop, what they look for. \n\nThis is by far the most compelling, unique, exciting, wonderful, and amazing dining experience I have ever had.\n\nI encourage everyone I know who enjoys food to go there. \nThe store front is small and intimate, it does not feel like being in downtown Mesa at all. \n\nThe price is $45 a person, and well worth it.

On any given Sunday the restaurant is packed with people and the wait is over an hour, but it is totally worth the wait. I have never had a bad experience at The Original Pancake House and I've tried many different dishes over the years. \n\nPerhaps my favorite dish at The Original Pancake House is their chocolate chip pancakes. Now I love a good chocolate chip pancake and it's very hard to get them done just right. Most of the places I've been to may put a few chips inside the pancake, but the majority of the chips are scattered on top of the pancakes. However, at The Original Pancake House they put tons of chocolate chips both inside the pancakes and on top of the whipped cream that's on the pancakes. This makes for a great combination of perfectly melted chocolate chips and hard chocolate chips on top that melt in your mouth.\n\nAlso another favorite of mine is the ham and cheese omelet. The omelet's at The Original Pancake House are absolutely huge and I don't think I've ever actually finished a whole omelet in one sitting. Not only are these omelets big, but they are also stuffed with whatever toppings you want, so you will not be disappointed with your meal. \n\nThe only reason I gave this restaurant a 4-star rating is because of the wait time and the noise level inside the restaurant (sometimes it gets pretty loud), but if I were basing my rating solely on the quality of the food then I would give The Original Pancake House a 5-star rating. The food tastes fantastic and it is very reasonable for the price.

Assumption was shots to background would move debris lead sometimes. They had issues and did not realize just how much lead collected in six months, they where finding lead kicked out to within five feet of the shooting bays.\nRegardless, I am a moderately experienced shooter and took the accusation poorly.

I was hoping to dine at Bobby Q, but I found the prices a bit too steep to dine alone, so I headed here.\n\nFound the menu uninteresting that day, perhaps bec. I was looking forward to good bbq fare, but I finally settled on the basics- hummus and falafel.  For those who care, the falafel were fried in soybean oil.  (Most places I've inquired at use corn, and sometimes peanut, oil.)  The platter looked very appetizing, but don't be fooled!  The hummus was very bland, and the falafel pieces weren't that great, either.  I had to ask for lemon to get some flavor out of the falafel, and the hummus' saving grace was that it lent the falafel some lubrication.  The pita bread was probably the best thing out of the whole meal, and that's not saying much.\n\nAfterwards, I checked out the bakery next door for some expensive baklava.  I chose three varieties, and I found them all too heavy on soggy phyllo and lacking in honey.  \n\n$13 for terrible baklava and $7 (or more) on less than mediocre hummus and falafel made for such a disappointing adventure that day.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.  Not even to anyone that didn't like me.  (But then again, I'd never do that, anyway.)", "type": "review", "business_id": "lzS66BeoLL0GRn1KrlmmFg"}

Snoh is located in the same plaza as Cherry Blossom Noodle Cafe (another bookmark I've had since moving into the valley many, many years ago- now I know where it's located, I'm going to have to stop in for a try!)  Parking looks very decent for the number of businesses around here- a big plus!\n\nThe line can get long very fast, but the two guys behind the counter take the orders very quickly (or as quickly as they can when newbies, such as myself, come in for the first time and are faced with so many choices!).  I decided to take the easy way out and try a couple of shaved ice flavors and a few toppings, so I went with the \"large plate\" for $6.75.  I spent my first decade, born and raised, in Manila, so I am very familiar with taro (we Tagalogs know it as \"ube\") ice cream, so I had to try Snoh's icy version, and added Green tea to the mix.  My toppings were cubed mango, red mung beans, and black sesame condensed milk.  It took about 8 to 10 minutes, but we had a large group present, and our lively conversations made the wait very easy.  This is what waited for me at the counter when my name was called... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/snoh-ice-shavery-phoenix?userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA#jyv16LcyCFb3Cz-Q3CkDxg  I have to say that while it didn't look very appetizing (mango cubes didn't present well, and neither did the black sesame drizzle-- why not just pour the milk, let it cascade down the icy landscapes, and just sprinkle roasted black sesame seeds on top?), I loved the taro, red mung bean, and black sesame condensed milk combo.  I thought the condensed milk overpowered the green tea ice, and I wouldn't order that match again.  However, I wouldn't mind having ust green tea ice.  It tasted very fresh and clean-- a great palate cleanser after a great meal.\n\nCool artwork and backsplashes.  Nice concept of posting photos of guests on the TV display, but does the staff check for total complacency of all those present in the pics, I wonder?

I knew the chest would be worse, so I nixed that for now. Then I did my arms, followed by my legs. The trimmer still works! Thank you Ross!\n\nBut, God knows I was scared sh**less when I called up European Wax Center and made an appointment for 7:30pm right after work.

She \"doot doot doot'ed\" and made fun conversation with this scared ass the entire time I was back up, whizzing around spreading hot wax on me. I had...once again... a ton of hair.

The place was a classic hometown American bar and grill (the sort that Applebee's aspires to become, but overcompensates for), and the menu was almost entirely hamburgers, with some salads, hot dogs, and cheese on the side.  It's a great place for families because there's a kids menu, and it's a good option for both vegetarians and ominivores/carnivores because there're certainly options for both.  Definitely not for a place for people with serious aversions to meat and above-average noise level at restaurants.\n\nWe had a cheese plate to start, which had some really great selections -- unfortunately forgot which plate it was, but it was the waitress' recommendation.  Also came with crackers, apple slices, and a bit of honey on the side, which made munching more fun.  \n\nI'd ordered #42, the roast beef tenderloin sandwich with a salad on the side.  The salad was very leaf-heavy without much of anything else, and I wasn't able to finish it.  The sandwich itself was good, nothing mind-blowing, I may've been slightly disappointed because I was ready to have my taste buds blown away by the \"tiger sauce\" and the \"shaved red onions\" that topped the sandwich, both of which sounded fun to a lifelong Easterner, and the texture of the beef made for very ungraceful consumption (think stringy).  If I were ever to go back (highly unlikely), I would order something else.  \n\nThe best part of meal was the dessert -- apple pie a la mode.  The apple pie itself tasted very classic, but not as sweet as expected -- which was perfect, because the vanilla ice cream that was put on top balanced out the palette.  But it didn't stop there -- the restaurant included a cross-section of Wisconsin cheddar which really expanded the taste bud action, because it added a new sort of tangyness, creaminess, and saltiness to the entire plate.  The tiny plate packed a bit of food adventure for sure.", "type": "review", "business_id": "FHqwLwpLjUjeLP-IdG_o_w"}

She can call and order a particular dish 24 hours in advance and it goes on the menu as the \"Angela\" special.  I think the story goes that she was the only person to order it the first time it was offered and she loved it and Cheryl (or Sheryl... I don't know how she spells it) loved her.  I've heard the food is a little better if you go with my bff than if you go without her.... but why would I ever go without her?

They also season the eggs without telling you with some herbs that turned out to taste ok but looked questionable. Two of us had ice tea, which was very weak and one had coffee but I no idea what he thought of it since he didn't have any more.\n\nOne of the cooks brought out a fresh baked blueberry scone as an apology for sending out a less than perfect breakfast.

Overall, I liked Giuseppe's a lot.\n\nAmbiance was that of a rustic Italianate setting with comfortable, high-backed booths and nice touches like faux-exposed bricks in a wall and photos of narrow lanes of one or more towns in Italy mounted around the dining room. Our choice of appetizer, Fried Calamari, started off the meal on a very high note. The lightly battered squid rings (all were rings--no tentacles) were just excellent and enhanced by a homemade, sweet and mild Marinara Sauce and a creamy White Lemon Garlic Sauce; the latter tasted like a fine Lemon Aioli. I had to consciously hold myself back from gobbling up all these morsels of the sea, so others at my table could enjoy some too! \n\nAfter this, things got a little frenzied, primarily because I ordered more items than I needed, to be able to flesh out a more comprehensive review of the restaurant's offerings. Since no veal was available (only sometimes on a few specials of the day), I opted for Spaghetti & Meat Sauce plus one meatball and mushrooms, which came with a cup of the soup of the day or salad. I discussed with my waiter whether to order one or two meatballs, and he suggested one because of the meat sauce. Since there were also several small meatballs in my order of Wedding Soup, boy, was he ever right! I am a sucker for Italian Wedding Soup; next to Onion Soup Gratinee, it is my favorite soup. So, when I saw this on the menu, I just could not pass it by. And, because the soup of the day was an interesting sounding Stuffed Green Pepper Soup, and I love stuffed peppers, I ordered this, too. Plus, since a regular Dinner Salad or Caesar Salad came with my wife's order of Chicken Parmigiana, and she doesn't eat any vegetables other than potatoes, that was also going to be consumed by me--which is what caused traffic control problems at my table. \n\nAfter the empty Calamari plate was cleared, the Stuffed Green Pepper Soup and the Caesar Salad were delivered to the table next--which was fine, along with very good Italian bread and offered vinegar and oil. But I had to ask for butter twice before it came, and wait awhile for replenishment of my glass of Sprite and for the second soup. When the Wedding Soup did finally arrive, it was in a giant bowl that could comfortably serve four. Yet it was all mine. So, I quickly downed the Stuffed Green Pepper Soup, which was simply superb. This dish featured ground beef and well-cooked pieces of carrot and celery in a flavorful broth, and tasted exactly like a stuffed green pepper--except the soup contained small torpedo-shaped dissolini noodles instead of rice. It then took me awhile to eat the fresh-tasting AND LARGE Caesar Salad with its crispy romaine lettuce, croutons, and fresh Parmesan Cheese shavings that was finished with a very nice and smooth creamy Caesar dressing while the second soup was waiting. The only discordant note involving the salad was finding a small piece of the inedible bottom of the head of the lettuce mixed in with the greens. At least I saw it before I tried to eat it! \n\nI got halfway through the second soup, and the entrees arrived. But I can't really fault the restaurant for the pileup of food on my table. For, once I tasted the Wedding Soup, it was obvious that it had just been made from scratch in the kitchen. Therefore, it probably took as long to construct this soup as the spaghetti, meat sauce, & meatball with mushrooms. And, my dining companions had a right to be fed, too, without waiting for me to finish off all of my several ordered preliminary dishes. \n\nWith tasty meatballs and large leaves of spinach floating in the very tasty broth, the second soup was also excellent.  But of course there was too much of it!  Even so, I wasn't going to let any of it go to waste, so I devoured it all. Surprisingly, my pasta dish was still piping hot when I began to tackle it. With its immense size and how laden it was with meat sauce, this imposing entree looked like a meatball-topped volcano of spaghetti that had recently erupted and discharged dark brown lava of meat sauce down its sides. It was the only dish of the night with which I was not thrilled, for on my first brush with the sauce it tasted more bitter than sweet. Real Parmesan Cheese was grated onto it by my friendly server, and the dish was still good--just not with as sweet a sauce as I prefer. But, at home the next day for lunch, I was pleased that any trace of bitterness in the microwaved meat sauce was all gone. \n\nSince everything was homemade, I just couldn't resist all of the tempting items presented on a large dessert cart.

But Rob really surprised me.  Because of the way he spoke, with respect, urging temperance, and shooting only as a last resort, my slight reluctance shifted into neutrality, then interest.  He taught the class in an impartial way, which can make a class really boring and dry.  But not Rob...he told so many personal anecdotes that it was impossible not to listen and wait for the next story.  Also, he emphasized safety, caution and discretion -- there was no rally cry to create an army of vigilantes.  \n\nRob was also a great instructor at the range.  He never rushed through any questions we had and made sure to give one-on-one pointers regarding stance, posture, grip, etc.\n\nI'm so happy I took the class -- it's a good feeling, knowing that I could handle a gun if I needed to, or disarm a gun if I found one.  And I couldn't have learned it so well without Rob.  I would highly, highly recommend this class to anyone, even the gun-shy (haha!).", "type": "review", "business_id": "41d9EvMf1SjCfhB6t29VyA"}

They have the standard massaging chairs and the typical selection of trash-culture celebrity magazines like People and US Weekly. Even though there's usually only two people working I've never had to wait more than 5 minutes before I'm in the chair. \n\nIf you're looking for a good place to get a pedicure and a little pampering for your feet, check out Nature Nails Center.", "type": "review", "business_id": "N-T3Ti7n9j7mA5XK8oHK9g"}

It has nice gigantic pic windows with a view of the strip skyline afar!\n\nLONG VERSION \n- This elegant restaurant in Sun Coast Casino Hotel is the former Primo Steak House, located on the 2nd Fl with elevator access. Upon exiting the elevator, you'll be greeted by its small charming bar lounge area, and a beautiful view of the Strip Skyline AFAR through its gigantic floor- to-ceiling picture windows. Its high ceilings, tri-level dining room setting and the nice view make the dining area elegant and inviting, with a comfortable ambience. The host/hostess and the friendly wait staff make guests feel welcome.\n\nOne evening in early Dec, our dear friends treated us to a memorable dinner here. Our friendly and knowlegeable young waitress, Rhonda, recommended 2 special appetizers, which were not on the menu: (1) Stuffed crabmeat mushrooms with and truffle sauce [$16], and (2) Mixed salad of grilled white and green asparagus, grilled artichoke and exotic cheese and sauce, [$15]. Both were eye pleasing and absolutely delicious! \n\nFor entrees, we had: \n(a) 8oz fillet mig\u00f1on, $34, and (b) $25 scampi. For extra $10 each,  the entree could add 1 lb of Alaskan King crab legs or a lobster tail. Yes, we each added the king crab legs or lobster tail! That was too great a deal to pass up, and they were scrumptious and totally worth of the price! We also polished off a very nice bottle of New Zealand wine ($60) with our meal, and it was very smooth and tasty!\n\nOur waitress was very attentive, cheerful AND SMART! She somehow noticed that we were toasting our friends for their 63rd Anniversary and she later surprised us with a good size complimentary chocolate cake dessert to share! A very nice touch indeed! - Mark of a good waitress and classy restaurant!\n\nWe totally enjoyed our dining experience that evening! We used to frequent its predecessor, Primo and liked it, but we really love the new SC Steak House. \n\nWhen we left the restaurant around 7pm, the dining room was almost full. There were quite a few happy people at the small charming bar as well.  We have not tried their happy hour, yet. Our waitress told us that it was excellent and quite popular.  \n\nHAPPY HOUR: [see pic of menu].\n- 4:30-7pm, daily except Tues\n- Drinks $2-7\n- Bar dishes, $5-10\n\nPeterskis, Dec 2012\n\n-----", "type": "review", "business_id": "0sXYr-llEjeeyHH9dwDpjg"}

The store is HUGE!\n\nThe chicken breasts are still the cheapest in town, the ground beef seems to be of good quality (no pink slime detected), and the produce seems to have good deals if you search through enough. Aisles and bathroom are always clean. The New York and Chicago products are well stocked.\n\nIn 2011, I even spent over $1000.00 in one shopping trip to pay for the high quality food at my own wedding. Glazier's used to be that great of a store.\n\nOver the years, Glazier's has become the MOST EXPENSIVE grocery store in Vegas. I have personally shopped at Glazier's, and went to Whole Foods to find an ORGANIC version cheaper than what Glazier's offers at non-organic.\n\nPrices are not the only thing that has changed.\n\n When walking in, a bouncer at the Dance Club-type greets you at the door. Immediately, you are to feel as though you are being watched. \n\nLondon Broil was on sale for $2.98/lb. I wanted it cut in half - so they charged me last week's price ($5.99/lb!) I did not even notice it until I got to the register, where I found it is \"new store policy\" if you make the butcher do anything other than hand you a piece of meat. Hope it worked out for them, since at the register I gave it back.\n\nOne other no-no here... I wanted to bag my own groceries.\n\nI worked in a grocery store as a kid. I am well trained to keep perishables together, produce together, etc.  I've been bagging groceries for almost 25 years! I'm told by the cashier it is \"a safety hazard\" if I bag my own groceries. This is a new one to me. Never in my life I have been told I could hurt myself from bagging my own groceries. If it was a \"safety hazard\", would Fresh & Easy be out of business by now? Surely the Health Dept would have shut down Winco and Food 4 Less as well. I don't see people in these grocery stores on the ground, writhing in pain from bagging their own food. \n\nOne other tidbit I noticed... sometimes I shop at 10pm. The donuts used to be \n25\u00a2 each after 7pm. Not anymore. Five minutes before closing you pay the same as if they were just made. There is no law that says they have to mark it down... but just saying... one less reason I go there.\n \nNaturally, since I did not get to bag my own groceries, I get home to find 3 items in the same bag... a cucumber, chicken breast, and dish soap. \n\nThis was a good store. I drove 10 miles each way to visit. However, \"Mr G\" has over-extended himself with petty policies and procedures. He has squeezed people like ourselves from shopping there on a regular basis. Instead of Glazier's I would recommend Sunflower market (soon to be Sprouts). \n\nGlazier's, I will still shop with you 2 to 3 times a year when I get cravings for New York stuff. Otherwise, I have found other places to go.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Z6aaze-cgaYKKXlpuH9LqA"}

I guess I felt like I needed a reason! Well, last week I had a reason to stop into Rick's Olde Gold, located across the street from St. Vinny's.  I had picked up a copper antique in Door County and wanted to know if it was possible to get it polished up because I was giving it as a gift to someone.  I love a good thrift store, and I had never thought of Rick's as such, but I will now! There are so many interesting items in that shop, not just antique or pre-owned jewelry, but antiques, funky art pieces, and other random objects of intrensic value. \nI stopped in on a busy day (the appraiser was in) so at first I felt like I may be in the way, but once I got someone's attention I was able to ask if they might have a way to help me out. I was told they were busy but they'd do their best to get around to it. \nI asked them how much money I should bring back with me when I picked it up and Rick said it'd be on the house because he didn't get around to helping me right away when I came in! Uh, awesome! Guess you don't have to be at a big box store to find great customer service, and, my gift looked AWESOME!

We loved it. Two manhattans apiece and all the nostalgia and cow we could handle in one night was a true bargain. The setting, overlooking the strip from atop Binion's downtown, is fantastic - use the glass elevator to get there! The restaurant, with dark wood paneling and lots of burgundy accents, conjures up a steakhouse atmosphere that I didn't think existed anymore. But this is no working theme park; the kitchen knows what it's doing for the most part. Service is friendly, efficient and professional. The food exceeded (admittedly low) expectations. My husband got the escargot to start, and they were well made in a very traditional garlic-herb butter. The salads were nice. Of course, being a steakhouse, beef is the star here, and Binion's delivered. My extra-rare filet was perfectly cooked and richly flavorful while my husband's rare ribeye was nicely seared and very tasty. It wasn't the very best steaks we've had, but it was very good indeed. The beef had that nice depth that Western beef seems to have. The only quibble with the meat is that it was underseasoned - we needed both the salt and pepper shakers on the table. The sides were a bit pedestrian; my husband's loaded baked potato was particularly clumsy but the vegetables were cooked properly. This is the place where time stood still, and we're grateful for that. It's a taste of old Vegas.", "type": "review", "business_id": "BvyARfwpde38566aiDM10w"}

I called to the office at the Mini Main Office as he told me that this lady(Becky) is the only one that can solve my problem. He didn't even leave me her number, so I asked him how can I reach her? He looked at me and didn't say anything. I asked him the second time and he still purposely ignored my question. I asked the third time and he finally looked up with the attitude and said in a harsh voice. I'm busy!!! Really?!!! Hard to believe of what I heard. Because when I walked in he was actually chitchatting with his coworkers and giggling. Yes I was very upset but tried to be nice and walked outside to look up the main office number myself. I called and finally reached Becky. She said that she has nothing to do with this and she told me to talk to a person that I sold my car to, which is Jerome!!!! I told her to hold on the line and passed this conversation in front of Jerome!! He's speechless and looked at me with guilt but he still denied to take care of my issue. Tomorrow I am going to talk to the store manager with a hope that one of them is actually give a real service and no bullshit! not just take the money and kick us out. If this doesn't work I am going to record everything these people are saying to me tomorrow and post on youtube and to show the world how these people are so *** up!!!\nI hope this experience of mine will help others and try to be aware of this Mini Cooper store especially Jerome!", "type": "review", "business_id": "9ubwquTfavXYSUlS1bMVqg"}

They are only open from 11 am to 5:30 pm on weekdays mainly to serve the downtown business lunch crowd, and the staff here seems to remember all their regulars which is impressive.

The Chinese chicken salad comes w/ the shredded rotissierie chicken that they roast daily, mandarin oranges and a light vinagrette dressing among other things and is overall a refreshing and filling salad especially with the portions they give here. Their Chicago style foods like the Italian beef/sausage/combo sandwich tastes even better with a side of giardiniera or G as they call it here, although it does cost a little extra.\n\nThey sometimes will have a special item that they made just for that day which is nice if you want something different.

Checked out the Red Elantra, new body, but 18,000 miles (!) and then the Blue 2013 Elantra. 686 miles. Didn't even look at the Corolla. Took the new car. \n\nDrove to the exit gate, the guy scanned the car, asked if we wanted to buy the gas option, NOPE, and then asked for the mileage on the car. \n\n\"Six Hundred Eighty Six\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"Six hundred eighty six\"\n\n\"86?\"\n\n\"No, SIX EIGHT SIX\" \n\n\"oh, ok.\" \n\nWhat does the contract say? 86. So my 600 mile trip is logged at 1600. Nice. \n\nI left a star off because it's common for ultra high mileage cars in Las Vegas, and I'm paying a premium to rent there. Don't always give me the beater when there are lower mileage cars to rent. Give the beater to the shady character, not your once a month or more renter...", "type": "review", "business_id": "mrkySnXq8JXeSemVXV1GSg"}

I've been living here in AZ for about 4 years and searching for the perfect cut and had yet to experience it. Or when I did, her schedule didn't jive with mine.\n\nSo I gave them a try and was booked with Ronoldo. My appointment was one of the last ones of the day and it was pretty much emptying out when I arrived. He was cutting someone's hair  when I arrived. I'm fine with waiting around, but half an hour later passed and I was still waiting! After half an hour I had my hair washed and he came over for a minute to see what kind of cut I was interested in. I think he assumed since I had a picture of my kids on my phone that I was okay not being at home and it was a break away and made a comment that implied that. Heck yeah, I appreciate a break from home but waiting around for half an hour isn't exactly relaxing!\n\nAnyways, I told him what I liked. My hair at that time was cut pretty decent. I could air dry and have nice wavy, beachy curls and look pretty good if I don't say so myself! I told him I liked my hair like it was now and if he could trim it up that was fine, and I offered him the opportunity to suggest if he could think of another style for me, and he didn't really answer. I also told him that when I didn't wear my hair like this I liked to flat iron it. My hair is super thick so it's easy for me to look like Cousin It when I want to!\n\nAnyways, all said and done and 1 1/2 hour later I came out looking like I had a mom hair cut. It was neither wavy curly nor flat ironed like I liked. (I think he called it a wrap style? Just blow drying and wrapping the hair around my scallp to straighten it out)  In the end I felt like it was the end of his day and he was ready to head out and he could care less.\n\nI had read some reviews out here about how they considered not only how your hair looks that day but how it would looks in a month or two when it grows out. Unfortunately I still hate it 2 months later. I like the salon but maybe not the stylists work. Looks like Ben's the way to go next time...Or to just find a new salon!", "type": "review", "business_id": "a2gl5lUljzEvvyDHLrM_0A"}

I just left there 15 minutes ago so this is still fresh in my mind.  Last week I made an appointment in person to schedule a front end alignment and to have some straightening cams (bolts) put in to correct some issues.  Today (Sunday August 11, 2013) I went in at 10:05am per my appointment time.  The assistant manager German stated that it would be about an hour to get it done and quoted me the price.  My first problem (minor) was the supply fee of $16 for rags and cleaning stuff... what?  I am paying separately for their stores supplies, are you kidding me!  As a business owner purchasing supplies is part of your business costs and I would never pass that on to my clients let alone say \"Hey, I am charging you for my supplies!\"\nAfter a 100 minute wait (just over an hour and a half) I got up and noticed that my car was parked outside and questioned why I was not called up to pay as I had other things to do in my day.  German stated that my ticket was hanging and was next.  In other words my car has not been touched the whole time I was there.  I asked what was the point of an appointment if I am treated like a walk-in!  He did not have an answer for me and I am perplexed why I was not informed of the delay after being told it would be about an hour.  I just sat there thinking my car was being worked on.  What puzzles me is that I saw my car on the hydraulic lift a few minutes after getting there and then was told by German that there was a truck in front of me.  Again, what was the point of making an appointment?\nNeedless to say I was furious that MY time was not valuable to them as I had other places to go that day.  Offering me a ride home was not the solution.  This is the typical Corporate mentality that I can not stand!  There was no consideration for my time and the nickel and dime on supplies was an insult to my wallet!  I can see now why most of the Big O tire reviews are two stars or below.  Should have went to Yelp before I went to Big O tires.\nIn addition when I asked the manager for his card he said that he did not have any (very strange).  When I asked him to write his name on the Big O tire envelope he said he would not because he was with a customer nor would he tell me his name.  As a manager he should be re-trained on how to handle disgruntled customers as NOT giving your name is not a best practice!  I will never go to or recommended Big O tires.  Discount Tire has the better reviews and that will be my next stop when I need tires.  As far as front end alignments I will support local community shops with good Yelp reviews.\nI will also send a copy of this to the BBB who will send a copy of that complaint to Big O tire corporate office.  I don't waste my time with corporate phone transfers to other departments.  I doubt very much that dealing with corporate directly would make any difference hence this Yelp review and the BBB.  If you are a potential customer reading this review I would steer clear of Big O and find a better shop to service you.\nAs a business owner myself I would never treat my client like this.  It is because of this that I have a 4.75 star rating on Yelp with 32 reviews!", "type": "review", "business_id": "hhNm4ar_1zn8Vu-cp8A-Lg"}

A nice touch is the special pastas and bruchettas they serve daily and those are listed on the back of the main menu.   On Sunday, they had a ricotta bruchetta with pesto and almonds.  I had never had the combination before and it was a wonderful starter.  The pesto was super garlicky which I love and with the housemade ricotta the flavors were strong and balanced.

We came here for dinner on a Saturday evening and really were looking forward to having a great experience as always. The bread-sticks are tasty, the salads and soups are always a pleasure to try since they seem to always have new ones coming out from time to time. But my issue is with the management and because of that our experience has tarnished Olive Garden in our eyes. \n\nOur server comes over and asks us for drinks. I have a glass of wine and my husband has a Italian margarita. We order our app and  a salad and my husband finishes his margarita and our server asks him if  he would like another. He agrees and asks her to order in another shot of tequila because the first margarita was a little light. She says okay and when she comes back with his margarita following right behind her is the Manager and asks him why he wants an additional shot, he explains and the GM then goes on long explanation on why they cant add additional shots in the drink and said moving forward tonight we are not going to be serving you any more alcoholic drinks.\n\n I was shocked! Two drinks and you are cut off. Maybe the manager was having a bad day, or maybe they only let you order two drinks. But this coming from a place where they are always pushing their wine and always go as far to leaving you a whole jug of it at your table this came off as a little odd.  My husband is a good sized man and two drinks and cut off I thought was a little too much. Most importantly this was rude and unprofessional.\n\nThis ruined our evening and it was very difficult for us to take anything positive from this. Since our order was in we waited for our entrees, ate them, paid the bill and left. I can honestly say that we are never coming back to Olive Garden in the future. \n\nI went online the next day and filled in the contact us questionnaire so that we could be contacted by someone at corporate and let someone know how not to treat customers that have been so loyal for so many years now but to this day I have yet to be contacted back, not an email or a call.

Seriously don't stay here. It is not safe. Make sure to also lock the swinging latch. This place has some shifty characters hanging around. Unfortunately I have to give a star for my review to go up.

We arrived at about 9:30 to a ZERO MINUTE WAIT (pft, Pane wants me to wait 3 hrs? I'd rather spend that time running back and forth between Pane and the Parlor feeding all of the hungry patrons waiting to get in Pane, the Parlor's delicious pizza and pitchers of draft beer).\n\nThe inside is large and in charge. Dimly lit and very earthy inside. Big comfortable booth looking out the window to a view of Camelback that was obstructed by a giant wall with the beginnings of vines growing on it. Who wants to look at 20th street and Camelback anyways? +1 star for ambiance and overall look. \n\nService was attentive most of the time, and although he forgot to get our straws and slipped up on one of our drinks, I'll give him the benefit of the doubt. He was cool and recommended we try one of the \"mashed\" drinks and we went with Strawberry, but was accidentally delivered a kiwi one. It was one of the best mixed drinks I've ever had. Very fruity yet still very alcoholic. We went with a pitcher (!!!!) of Kiltlifter for 14bucks.  Not bad, we got 4 beers out of it. All of their beers are on draft and can come in the pitcher size.  They even serve PBR! +1 star for awesome drinks.\n\nWe went with 2 personal 8in pizzas.  I think it is a great concept to allow patrons to design their own pizza with toppings and cheeses.  We got a pepperoni one with parm and a house sausage one with feta and basil and spinach.  Both came out in a reasonable time and were crispy as hell.  Delicious! Both pizzas were cleared within 10 minutes.  The house sausage was spectacular and I highly recommend it to anyone visiting the Parlor.  Very good pizza for the price, much cheaper than a Cibo or Pane pizza and of comparable quality, minus the wait and snobby staff. +2 stars for price and pizza.\n\nI see myself visiting the Parlor many times in the future.  Great beer, food, and atmosphere.  Service could be a little more attentive and personal but it was acceptable.  Phoenix has some amazing pizza in it's valley and can totally play with the big pizza boys of Chicago and New York. the Parlor can definitely hang.", "type": "review", "business_id": "pwpl-rxwNRQdgqFz_-qMPg"}

Very crafty how the bill is due JUST before most people would pay their bills from their paycheck on the 15th. \n\nThey charge me 1.5 times my bill for the last 12 months. Now remember, I have only been there for 5 months so rather than judge it on MY last bills which are low, I have to be averaged off of another family. So the deposit was massive. \nSo I tell them (based on principal) that I cannot afford to pay it. So they say they will separate it into 2 payments (how generous). So I make the first payment of 80. Mind you, this is NOT for services rendered. \nNext month I get my bill in the mail, and like every month, I pay it.  \n\nFew days later my power gets shut off.

I quickly log on to my bank and see it was paid and I tell them this. They say, \" no, it was for security deposit\". I asked them what do I owe on my service. They said nothing. I said, so I got disconnected over an arbitrary deposit when my bill is paid in full? They said yes. \n\nThey then tell me there is a reconnection fee and if I want it done that day there is 100 rush fee.  Now, this is all happening in the morning. I went to the gym and came home within the hour. So you know the service guy was within a mile. \n\nI talked to the \"manager\" and he was \" nice enough to cut me a break\" and not charge a reconnection fee. So I waited until the next day so I wouldn't have to pay the rush fee, and avoid reconnection. So because it was a cool 115 that day, I had to sleep at my gf's, WITH MY 2 KIDS!!!!\n\nThe next day all of my food was bad and still cost me over 100 for no reason.  \n\nAPS needs to be stopped and there needs to be regulation. \n\nRyan.", "type": "review", "business_id": "8NYxph3a9bKBr86zPQNTIA"}

When i got there however and went through the process, the \"deep cleaning\" didn't seem like a deep cleaning at all.  The initial cleaning the first day seemed more thorough and hurt longer. They did all four quadrants in one session, no novicaine (which if you've had a deep cleaning before...it HURTS.....I needed the nitrous oxide the last time I had one.....and it hurt for multiple weeks after as well when I went before).  One of my friends that also has had deep cleanings also said that they're painful and hurt for days afterwards.  This one instead didn't hurt except when i was poked a few times, and i was fine to eat/etc right afterwards.\n\nWhile getting the deep cleaning the hygenist (because I never saw the dentist except for the fillings when in the past I saw them for deep cleanings as well) said that my mouth was much better and that she thought the pockets (the reason for the deep cleaning) were probably false pockets, that my mouth was much better than the previous month, that I probably didn't need the deep cleaning and that no antibiotic would be needed...maybe if I came in next time I would need them.  So I got a deep cleaning that I may not have needed, didn't feel like a deep cleaning, and set me back $900....in about an hour (they also usually take longer)\n\nPoor experiences multiple times...\n\noh--and never met Carl.", "type": "review", "business_id": "FoZAwudo-SFiT7fV9F1baw"}

I do wish they'd put chairs instead of benches.  Slightly awkward if you're alone or want to really relax.\n- Gorgeous grounds\n- delicious desert counter in the evenings in the lobby!\n\nHowever,\n- We booked online through the Starwood website.  None of our requests (only 2) were sent to the hotel.  We're talking simple things like non-alergenic pillows and high floor.  We got in late, so I addressed it the next morning and was told whoever booked it must not have transferred the codes.  I showed her the notes on my printed confirmation and told her I don't care what internal issues are involved.  Bottom line, I didn't get anything I requested.  \n- Room had an adjoining door.  Luckily the first night, nobody was next door.  The 2nd night, I got to listen to the couple next door talking, watching TV, and then having sex.  At the sex point I finally called the front desk (after 11pm) and told them I need another room to sleep in and that I'm leaving my stuff here.  I just want to sleep and come back in the morning.  The sent me to a room in the middle of a hallway completely surrounded by other rooms, more than my first room.  I refused - finally got a room at far end of hallway and slept soundly.  Next morning when trying to charge breakfast and other items, staff kept saying we checked out.  Had to explain over and over that we're not checked out.  Anyway, it wasn't the couple's fault next door - the walls are just paper thin.\n- Tried to book a cabana at adult pool in advance, but was told they only do full day cabana rentals.  Bummer.  Didn't reserve one since I knew I wouldn't be to pool until 2pm.  Got to pool and probably only 4 out of about 15 cabanas appeared to be booked.  Apparently, they'd rather leave money on the table instead of doing half day rentals of cabanas.  Oh well.  They could have made more that day.  Spoke to pool manager later (just by chance) and he said, oh, see me next time.  I can arrange it for you.  OK, well I called the number on the website for cabana rentals.  Apparently, that's not the route to take.  The spa doesn't have the authority to do 1/2 day.  DON'T make me jump through hoops to figure out who to talk to.  I'm just trying to spend money!!!  The cabanas are not worth it anyway.  They're just patio tables under the tent.  Not like other hotels that have TV's, ceiling fans, etc.  These cabanas are old and outdated.\n- Pool service ended at 6, at which time children are allowed at the adult pool when their's closes.  At 6pm there was probably still 25 adults at the pool.  Such a shame, more money left on the table.  These people would continue to order food and drinks if they could.  Oh well.\n- Pool menu is very limited for drinks.  If you want white zinfandel, you're set.  There's only 3 wines and they won't go to another bar to get more options (I kept forgetting I'm not at the Four Seasons).  What you see is what you get and we're not going to do anything else.\n- 1 server for entire adult pool area.  This is Scottsdale and it's high season.  Seriously - get some help out here.\n- Green your room - this is one of those hotels where you're assaulted with fliers about reusing your towels, get extra SPG points for not having maid service, save water, save our world, etc.  How about no maid service, & give me $50 off my bill.  Why tell me to conserve water when you have green grass surrounding your entire resort, including alongside the pool, driveway, walkways, etc.  How about instead of telling me to conserve water, you conserve water and rip out some of your unnecessary grass in the DESERT!  If I'm paying your rates, I want a fresh towel!  Do you really need grass lining the 1/4 mile long driveway and around the pool that needs watered year around?  \n- I'm not cheap, but the room service breakfast prices are seriously out of control.  I think the cheap breakfast was $24.00 + $3.00 delivery + 22% gratuity.  Really?  22% we're charging now???  When will it cap out?  And I don't understand the delivery fees hotels charge for room service.  Work it into the $24 eggs I'm ordering and $14 pot of coffee.  What's my alternative?  Will you let me go to the kitchen and bring it up myself?  I will.\n\nOK - I'm out of room to type according to Yelp.\n\nAfter talking to manager at check out about the noise issue and requests not honored at check in, no refund, no discount, just extra SPG points.  Gee thanks.  I had to come through your lobby in pajamas at 11pm and you can't offer a break for my inconvenience????", "type": "review", "business_id": "SYqTY48DJa1cYhglvmgvsQ"}

I had seen mixed reviews about the happy hour service so I wasn't sure what to expect, but I generally try to keep an open mind about these things until I've experienced the restaurant for myself. Hey, you don't earn the Maverick badge by following the pack! \n\nAnd so our culinary adventure at Kabuki began with placing our names on the wait list to build the anticipation. I take it as a good sign that this restaurant was quite busy and it was only 6:30p. We enjoyed the beautiful fall weather outside while we waited and were delighted to hear our name called within 10 minutes - much sooner than anticipated. \n\nWe were seated at a table and promptly asked for our drink order. We opened our menus and I was pleased to see there was a photo displayed for each dish, which made it hard to decide because they all looked delicious! We decided on 2 specialty rolls and a \"little baby tuna roll\" (as my friend said). \n\n-Tuna Roll ($4.95)- 6 tiny pieces (also known as Norimaki or a \"nori roll\"): nothing special\n\n-Sunkissed ($10.95) - Spicy tuna roll topped with Fresh Salmon and slices of avocado: decadent and delicious!\n\n-Rainbow Roll ($11.95) - California Roll topped with fresh slices of an assortment of fish (tuna, yellow tail, salmon, shrimp): quite delicious and beautifully prepared\n\nOverall, I was quite happy with Kabuki Japanese Restaurant. Sadly, there was no Kabuki theater performance but there are large flat screen TVs for those that want entertainment during happy hour. The server took a little while to confirm our sushi order, but he was friendly enough and came to refill our waters. He even a arranged to have the patio door closed as it was creating a draft for my friend. The sushi may not be \"fresh off the boat\" because well, where's the nearest ocean in Tempe? But the quality of the fish is certainly better than most other sushi restaurants.

Good tea flavor, not overly sweet at all, good boba consistency.\n\nSzechwan pork noodles were also tasty. Came with free small soup which was good as well. Large portion, definitely works best for family style (like most Chinese food).\n\nBaos are really large, might have preferred 4 smaller ones instead of two large ones. These were at least twice the normal peking duck bao's size which means the bao to meat ratio seems a little off. The Bao itself was very tasty, the was duck a little dry though. Could have used some of the sauce you use for peaking duck maybe but I might be showing my ignorance of Cantonese cuisine here, not sure if this dish is a \"fusion\" version of a peking duck bao or an authentic example of some Catonese variant that's larger and doesn't use the same sauce. Dipping the extra bao in the sauce from the Szechwan noodles though was delicious. \n\n\nSuper friendly service! Though there weren't a ton of other people in the restaurant while I was there.

Here's why:\nAt first the experience was NOT good:\n-We were seated next to a huge party that was so loud I couldn't even hear my friends. The place was full so we weren't able to switch tables and it really ruined the whole dining experience because we couldn't even talk to each other!\n-Food took foooorever to come out and, when it did, some of it was missing and some of it was wrong. The tempura veggies weren't even cooked!\nBut they did a LOT to try to make it better:\n-They comped our veggies and brought us complimentary tempura shrimp and shots for the table\n-The manager came over and personally apologized for the loudness and the mishaps we'd had with our food\nAnd overall, the service was great considering how busy the place was. The food did take a long time to come out, but we weren't in a rush so it was fine.\nIn terms of quality food - the tempura shrimp were amazing! The specialty sushi rolls were great, but the regular rolls were nothing special (literally nothing to them - could make them at home yourself). I'd say don't waste money on the \"regular\" rolls - get the specialty ones! They're pricier, but you get more (8 pieces instead of 5 or 6) and with many more flavor combinations, sauces, etc.\nSo overall I'd say to give the place a chance. It has good food, good service, and good drinks.", "type": "review", "business_id": "rfDTJLEwZZ2EGOZiTDdqQA"}

( I moved back home after school and was a member for 6 months)\n\nThis place felt so pretentious when I first walked in- then I joined after my 7 days was up. Best decision I made in my life.  Everyone was so friendly.\n\nI got two personal training sessions and Matt did a great job. He wasn't pushy and didn't overly pressure me to buy anything...this led up to me buying more training sessions on my own accord. I lost 20lbs with his help.\n\nI would take my lady friends (even my mother in-law) here to hang out in a spa like environment. The club advisers who signed me up would get me free passes for my friends to use so we could \"get away\" and relax at a gym. This place was like a huge spa. I always felt energized after leaving this place. Who goes to relax at the gym anyway? Always thought it was sweat and tears until I came here.\n \nMy husband got a couple hair cuts at the salon and I did a  Brazillian. I was given a cup of hot tea and they put a hot lavender scented sash thing that helped relax my shoulders before my wax session. The woman who did it was quick and very nice to keep me talking so I would be distracted from the pain. I also let her know it was my first time.\n\nI wish they would open up a club in my state!

Compared to other rooms I've stayed in, this one was pretty clean.\n\nIt was very modern and fun, and a great room for the price. We got the upgraded room, with a huge tub and mirrors, plus complimentary champagne for about $100. They forgot our champagne at first and made up for it by bringing us chocolate covered strawberries.\n\nThey let us in the room way before check-in time, per my request, which was nice.

Not really a problem of the resort, but of that one staff member.\n\nI do recommend this hotel, it was a lot of fun. Did I mention we did a photoshoot in the room?

True New York style for sure (reminds me a little of Johns Pizzeria in Midtown Manhattan). I had a 9\" meat lovers & my partner had a 9\" white.

Most other places would have been all \"um no, sorry\" or \"well ok, but you'll have to pay extra.\" Not here--no problem at all! I'm generally not a cheese pizza fan, but that white pizza was oh so yummy! The crust was just right (not to thick but not paper thin), and they had no problem getting the cheese extra brown for me either. I'd always heard & read great things about Hawthorne's (& didn't realize there were other locations), and tonight I see they're all true. I think H's is my new favorite \"pizza joint!\" \n\nThey also had a great selection of pastas & salads too; not just the kind a lot of other places have that look like an afterthought; like \"oh yah, and we serve this stuff too just in you don't want pizza.\" These looked like true, restaurant-quality dishes. Can't wait to try'em! \n\nThe atmosphere was cozy & very welcoming & \"local.\" Although it wasn't busy, there were several regulars that the staff knew, so that says a lot about the place.

And up till now, every time I go to Bachi, it's always full. This unfortunately can be a problem. Seating is limited and I once waited 30 minutes to get a table for 2. They did offer to put in our order so the food would be ready by the time we were seated. This also relates to a second problem I have with Bachi: the wait time for food. It takes longer than average to get your food once you've ordered it. But if you're patient, you'll be rewarded. Don't let impatience ruin your Bachi experience.\n\nDespite these few issues, Bachi Burger is awesomely delicious. I've had the opportunity to sample almost every item on the menu and everything is good. I appreciate the creativity and flavor combinations in the different specialty burgers. My favorite happens to be the Bachi fish burger (fish? at a burger place? i know...).

I'm here at least 2-3 times a month, sometimes even twice a week!\n\nI really appreciate the love and dedication that Johnny puts into his craft. He cares about the quality and taste of every meal that comes out of his kitchen, the way his staff interacts with customers, and the overall ambiance of the restaurant. I think he has mastered this craft.\n\nBeing a vegan I have a plethora of options, which makes me very happy! The mango papaya spring rolls are incredibly refreshing and pair well with the spicy peanut chili sauce, the wasabi tofu is a great crunchy and spicy transition into the incredibly flavorful Hong Kong Flat Rice (I add tofu) or Spicy Saigon with Tofu. Both dishes are loaded with snow peas, cauliflower, onions, and carrots and tons of flavorful sauce in a skillet with crunchy tofu.\n\nAnother chart topper for me is the hot and sour soup with tofu. Try the sweet chili sauce that comes on the side for a sweet, spicy, and salty adventure! The red tofu curry is amazing as well. VERY filling. \n\nI'm a huge fan of the plain 'ol vodka tonic, but love that they infuse their own vodkas with a variety of things like chili's and lychee. Dallas G LOVES the \"hot and dirty\" and I am also a fan of the \"Cucumber chill.\" Although I cannot drink beer anymore, the White Ale is a chart topper.\n\nThey also have a great selection of Sake. I took part in their sake tasting last night and became a fan of several new sakes! We downed a bottle of Pure Dawn and were really excited to see the discount after partaking in the tasting! Bonus!\n\nOverall, Sens is definitely my favorite restaurant. The food, the drinks, the love.... and we know all of the waiter/tresses so it makes for an even better experience!\n\nPS...

The fried pickles were not too good, pickles were sort of mushy (star deduction) For now I will stick to ordering my fried pickles at Memphis BBQ or Lucile's. \n\nSecond star deduction is the price.

Their standard french fries are nothing spectacular, I'd go an say they're just average, however, their beer battered french fries are amazing.

Not a bad note anywhere. I ordered the much recommended crispy pork belly and there's a reason why everyone is raving about it: it's THAT good. Melt-in-your-mouth perfection sitting in a smooth creamy sauce. It will definitely whet your appetite for more! The hanger steak was just as divine. A simple, juicy steak, which I ordered medium, and it came as medium, smothered with chimichurri sauce, that wonderful South American parsley and garlic condiment, along with just perfect, crispy homemade fries. The pecan pie was rich, creamy and just the right amount of sweet. I was loving every bite.  \n\nEverything was going along swimmingly until the young yuppie family from hell showed up next to our table.

The waitress told me that they are no longer honoring the cerrtificates.  I asked to talk to the manager.  The manager told me that they have not been accepting the certificates for the past year.  I bought my certificate exactly 1 year ago.  How can they sell a certificate and not honor it?  I own a successful business in Las Vegas for over 20 years.  I can not believe a business would conduct business this way.  Make me think they offered the certificates to get people to come to their bar, and when they cash out they can not use the certificate.  I call this fraud.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Nqcl3hDLyiwNQBxQpKCdIQ"}

WOW they stilll let me in, i really dont know how. i pretended my shoe was a sandal and not heels. up the elevator we go! Now, i dont remember how we got to our VIP table, but we did and with more drinks (bad idea for me). I remember wanting to dance.. but yeah since my heel was broken, they said it was dangerous and i was not allowed on the dance floor *cries* so i did my own little dance around our VIP table. also, youre not allowed to dance on the couches.. sigh.\nand no lapdances.\n\nwhen i was pretty much done for the night (which didnt take long), i needed shoes to get home, and i needed to pee. Bathroom is actually super dark and very hard to find WHY IS IT DOWN STAIRS? i really dont understand why people put stairs at a bar or club because that is so hazardous to everyones drunken health. makes holding up people a lot harder too. Anyways. bathroom is alright. theres a lady in there helping people and selling shit. ... like a pair of flip flops... for $10.. A part of me wanted to say yes, but the drunk me kinda said fuck that and walked out. Then next thing i know, i waking up on my friend's bed probably 4 hours later.....\n\nbut the overall club decor is prettttyy nice. The dance floor is actually pretty small. i thought'd itd be bigger but i guess not. They have flat screen TVs lining the ceilings with these light thingies that moved with the beat of the music. The VIP tables were pretty nice, ours was on the 2nd level overlooking the dancefloor. pretty cool. The cocktail waitresses poured the drinks strong and security guards were nice and pretty chill. I'd give this place 3 stars but they didnt kick me out..... so ! 4 stars it is", "type": "review", "business_id": "NrmjX7lp8LfqdJSd83P9-Q"}

Some young kid cuts to the front of the line with his buddy and the cashier sees him and says nothing just welcomes him to the counter and takes his order like nothing happened. Another girl decides to jump on the register by the door ans screams out next ...i look to see if the guy in front of me is going to go and she yells out looking at me ..come on who's next lets go. I walk up and ask her for a hamburger meal with avocado and a chocolate shake. She says do you want fries with that.... i say ..yes i just told you i wanted the meal. She replies with you obviously need to speak up because i didn't hear you....she then is banging away on her register to show me she is irritated with me then snaps at me and says what size shake do you want....i tell her small and she makes me repeat it again.  She tells me the total and snatches the 20.00 out of my hand and gives me back the change. I ask for a receipt and she rolls her eyes at me and bangs away again on the register hands me receipt and turns her back on me walks to the back counter and turns and looks at me while she is talking to someone else to let me know shes discussing me. The woman was thin and dark skinned with a long black ponytail and a nasty disposition. \nTicket number 488813-2  at 12:54 sever 20- shelby.\n\nI hope a manger speaks with her about the simple kindness she could show her guests and that a pleasant attitude and smile could go a long way .

However, the star for me, was the Pork Belly buns.  Crunchy, salty, sweet and chewy all in a single bite.  It was heavenly and covered in a delicious hoisin sauce, balanced perfectly by a pillowy sticky bun that I wished would self-regenerate so it wouldn't disappear.\n\nWhile we started our meal, we noticed a server prowling the restaurant with a bowl brimming with liquid nitrogen and the sort of smoke that you see in a sci-fi science lab.  He was serving freeze dried bubble gum meringue, for fun and free-of-charge.  \"Eat it fast,\" he said, dropping a 'kiss' shaped dessert into our hands, \"it's really cold.\"  We popped each playful \"kiss\" into our mouths and blew cold smoke rings as we crushed the delicate and flavorful meringue.  This single experience was enough for us to save room for the dessert menu.\n\nFeeling glutinous and somewhat playful, we decided to try some of their more childish desserts.  We ordered a Cereal Bowl shake (which tasted exactly like a bowl of Captain Crunch, with premium ice cream and vodka) and something called an Ice Cream Truck, basically ice cream served 4 ways.

This is your typical lower end chain seafood restaurant, trying so desperately to be relevant anymore that it's sickening.\n\nI ended up at this joint because someone in my extended family wanted to go here for her birthday dinner. With 10 of us. Ugh.\n\nWhile I was waiting for other to arrive in front of the restaurant, a server and someone from the kitchen walked up. They stopped about 10 feet from me. I could hear their (overly loud) conversation perfectly. They were looking at a phone and talking about \"sucking on them f******* ti***es.\" Completely inappropriate, considering there were other guests all around. \n\nNext up, we get to our table. The servers were very polite and seemed to be on point, which is a nice surprise to find in a place like this. Halfway during everyone's salads, some obnoxious overly-cocky d-bag of a food runner comes up with his tray and tries to auction off entree items. First of all, if you see we are still eating salads, go screw yourself, dude. Second of all, you had like 3 entrees for 10 of us. Third of all, when we tell you no one ordered those items, perhaps you should believe us instead of arguing with us until our server comes and directs you to the correct table. Yikes.\n\nSalads leave, CORRECT entrees come. The food here all tastes the same. The steak is poor quality (what do you expect from an Olive Garden-esque seafood restaurant?) The shrimp all taste the same. The king crab is waterlogged. Everything is just \"meh.\" All tastes like greasy, buttery, garlicky goo. Everything. Literally. Yes, really. The saving grace here is probably the cheddar biscuits, which are delicious, but again, like eating a stick of butter.\n\nEntrees leave. Desserts come. Yay! Happy Birthday. They have this \"innovative\" thing where they serve the dessert in a mason jar. Listen up, Red Lobster: not only is it not innovative, it only \"kind of\" works when you actually have employees that LAYER the items in the jar carefully and take the extra time to make it look nice. It looked like a hot mess; like someone took the frozen red velvet sheet cake from Sysco and broke it up into 3 inch chunks and stuffed it in the jar. Ick.\n\nThe most humorous part of this visit for me was watching someone drop whipped cream all over the ground to the side of our table. I watched, and I only wish I was exaggerating here, 10 people, INCLUDING MANAGERS, walk by and LITERALLY move their head down to see the myriad of whipped cream on the floor, and continue to do NOTHING about it. HA! I was laughing out loud at the absolute ineptitude and lack of caring among everyone in this restaurant. \n\nI can only imagine the soul-dying that not only happens when you dine here, but when you work here. I heard Darden is trying to get rid of this concept and unload it, which from watching the s**tshow in this place, makes complete sense. Just to be clear, however, our servers were VERY positive, VERY friendly, and did a great job (other than not cleaning up whipped cream.) It's just everything else about this place that makes me... well... Seafood Differently.", "type": "review", "business_id": "YgRCJtt7pGvwlb9Ktumeeg"}

The combination of ingredient was perfect.  Each of the flavors shined through without being over powered by the others.  The creamy texture of the crab mixture was nicely contrasted by the crunchy caviar.  The fennel gave the dish a pleasant aromatic feel which i love very much.  The portion was so generous but i think i could handle muuuuch more :-)\n\nLes Crustaces (supplement): Roasted lobster on cauliflower with green curry, truffled langoustine ravioli with chopped cabagge (signature dish), delicate flan of sea urchin with mocha foam\n\nFor the entree i got turbot sauteed with matsutake which was excellent, my aunt got the seafood medley which looked pretty but  there was a weakness in flavor combination, imho.\n\nThe dessert cart was as i expected to see with at least 30 different choices of cakes, candies, chocolate.  The hostess patiently described many of them and each of us ended up with about 10 different kinds.  Each piece was exquisitely done in miniature form and delicious.\n\nThe food, the decor, the bread/dessert carts, the limousine ride showed that the 3-star Michelin restaurant like this stands in a different class compared  to other restaurants.

The hotel opened in February, 2012, according to the desk staff. The hotel and rooms were clean, well-built, and modern. Especially loved the high-pressure showers with variable temp and pressure that worked consistently, no surprises. One minor plumbing issue resolved same day with the desk staff. Attached restaurant serves full or continental breakfast plus lunch and dinner although we never tried it for lunch. We bought the package that included full breakfast and was glad I did. Really set the tone for the day with a nice hot breakfast in your stomach. Restaurant staff efficient and courteous. Also includes an attached Costa Coffee shop - service and offerings also top-notch, quick, and friendly. Nice flat-screen LCD TVs in the rooms with full cable-type channel lineup. Only down-side was the wi-fi. It really was finicky and the registration process was cumbersome, billing was inept - hey Premier Inn, take a look into making this easier for your guests, because it was a craptastic distraction to an otherwise memorably great hotel stay.", "type": "review", "business_id": "lXpOMMVeNqAH1OSiuGumng"}

If you want a late night manicure than this place is basically the only option, however in my opinion it's better to just wait until morning so you can go somewhere else. \n\nGel manicures normally run $25-$30, however at this salon it's $40. Which to start with is crazy over priced, but worse than that, the woman I worked with made me pay before I actually got any polish put on. It was very odd and very uncomfortable, how am I suppose to tip on a service I haven't had yet? Plus I feel as though you should always pay after so you actually know what you're paying for. \n\n My nails are nicely shaped and the police came out with the good strong color I was hoping for. However none of that was really the manicurists doing, my nails were basically already shaped and I picked red polish, you can't really screw up that color. \n\nThe manicure portion of the manicure was quick and to the point, she even almost forgot to buff my nails and had to call me back before I washed my hands. \n\nAs I said before the polish came out on well but at the end there was no lotion or hand massage that you would normally get. So I basically dropped $40 just to get my nails painted. Which in my mind is a rip off since I can get that and more for $25.", "type": "review", "business_id": "mbbgs8HS0meLkmeWWWE-pQ"}

I am so happy he did because the food was darn good and the price was so reasonable. \n\nMy boyfriend and I ordered a few things from the menu to share...but the best dish was the palace pan roast...it was so GOOD!!!  Absolutely loved it. Lobster, crab, chicken and sausage were what was in the pan roast, yummy!!! You can order the spiciness of the pan roast on a scale of 1-10. We ordered a six and it wasnt too spicy at all. So the next time we go back I think we will move up the spiciness scale to 7 or 8.  \n\nWe also ordered the clam chowder. The clam chowder was delicious. It definitley was one good bowl of clam chowder.\n\nThe oysters were also delicious and there were all kinds of sauces for it. Beers were inexpensive too. If you ordered the 24 or 50 oz you can keep the glass and next time you bring the glass back to any restaurant at Palace Station you get half off for a refill. \n\nThe reason why I docked off a star was the place is pretty tiny so  there will always be a wait everytime you come. We waited a little over an hour to get seated but the line definitely got longer after we came. \n\nThe staff was great. The chef was funny and joked around with us a lot. The only thing is that the place only had the chef and a waitress working so at times it took a while to get to us or clean out the empty seats.

We got there after 6:30, hoping to grab a table or seats at the bar & make our orders quickly before HH ends at 7.  Well of course the bar seats & every table was taken.  All of the waiters/waitresses seemed so rushed & overwhelmed.  We finally found the hostess & asked for a table for three.  As she went off to look for a table, another hostess came up to us.  I specifically stated that we were there for HAPPY HOUR.  And she was like WELL ARE YOU EATING?  I had to make this point twice.  Then the first hostess came back & said she could seat us upstairs (I didn't even know they had a second floor!).\n\nWell, bad idea.  First, the decor upstairs was a lame attempt at making the Oyster House look the least bit classy.  Then, the waitress told us happy hour is only available downstairs.  Wow.  After a second look for an available table downstairs, we decided to just stay on the second floor & pay the regular price for oysters ($12 per dozen versus $10 per dozen during HH).  The service upstairs was super slow.  The waitress wasn't even paying close attention when we made our orders because she definitely forgot my friend's beer.  The good thing was she comped it since he waited for like over half an hour.  The oysters tasted extra fishy that day, not like the first time I tried them here.  I lost my appetite for anything else after that.

I was naturally intrigued when I found out that there would be a smoothie and acai bowl place opening up in its stead. I think this is a great location for acai bowls, since Sprouts is just a few steps away, bringing in the more health-conscious crowd.  I went in with high hopes of getting a healthy, fruitful bowl.\n\nThere are quite a few bowls to choose from, some of them fruity, others more dessert-like, with peanut butter and chocolate.  I opted for a fruitier bowl, getting the tropical.  This was my first time trying an acai bowl, and it was quite tasty.  The bottom layer was a smooth, thick acai puree/sorbet-like mixture, which tasted berry-like.  There was crunchy, sweet granola layered in between the acai and the tropical fruit (Banana, mango, and pineapple), with large, thin shaved pieces of coconut completing the bowl. The granola itself was a high quality mixture, containing ingredients such as flax seed. The bowl was a nice mixture of textures and of tastes.  I ordered a small (About $5), and it definitely filled me up!\n\nService was very friendly, and they offer a points reward system which uses your e-mail to keep track of your purchases.  The interior is pretty bare-bones, and it seems like they kept much of the same color scheme as the previous owner.\n\nDefinitely a good place to go if you're looking for a healthier alternative to dessert, or if you want a lighter (Yet filling) meal for breakfast, lunch, or dinner!", "type": "review", "business_id": "xfZhTtsYzY95B4IG0FHXSA"}

Enough justification to come back next week, in my opinion.", "type": "review", "business_id": "OVuVPBSkCPCNCuc25Tn-Vw"}

Beautiful place but it does not work and the staff couldnt give a shit! It even took 2 calls when I got home to get a manager who just did the \"what can I do for you\" bs like comp my room, I'm never going to stay there again!", "type": "review", "business_id": "AtjsjFzalWqJ7S9DUFQ4bw"}

This place has probably one of the best patios in Phoenix and the coolest part is that it is an old historical district house that was transformed into a mom and pop style italian kitchen. I have tried quite a few things on their menu from the burrata and proscuitto to multiple different pizzas and they have managed to walk away unscathed and for that, the patio, the service, and ambiance I think they deserve 5 stars.", "type": "review", "business_id": "V1nEpIRmEa1768oj_tuxeQ"}

Loved the atmosphere.  We had some great but way expensive champagne (30 dollars a glass).  Ordered the sampler roll (48 dollars) and fatty tuna-avocado roll.  It was not bad fish, but there was nothing special about it to have paid what we paid.  The sampler roll had fish that had a pureed texture.  Not appetizing at all.  Not a big roll either.  The tuna and avocado roll was so plain and not filling that my friend and I decided that was the end of this dinner.  No more wasting money here. What a  huge disappointment.  We of course went somewhere else to have a real dinner.  Just because a seemingly nice restaurant is in a nice hotel, does not mean it has five star food.  Next time I will look on yelp.  I would of known better if I had.", "type": "review", "business_id": "sD38Tp5O4W06Bx-DxeW9oQ"}

We stayed @ the Luxor.  This hotel is a total disappointment.   The room had 2 queen beds, and enough space for 3 women to unpack and move around.   WE requested for a nonsmoking room and per the lady at the front desk, we got a nonsmoking room.  But the smell of smoke was so heavy, it felt like there is a man sitting in the closet just blowing out smoke all day long.   The closet must of somehow suffered from some kind of water damage because the wood at the base was bended.   The room was dark, the wall paper looks like it needed to be replace.   Next is the bathroom.  There was a hole on the wall in the bathroom.  No joke, a hole in the wall.  This hotel is nothing like anything I would expect from a 4 stars hotel in Vegas.

A large open dining area lined with exposed brick and a well lit / inviting bar area.\n\nTheir menu seemed to cover all of the important bases, for breakfast the have the staples of steak and eggs, french toast, etc - but also offer a chicken and waffles option.
