I've had contacts since I was 16, so I'm not new to eye exams, glasses, or contacts. I've always paid out of pocket at Costco, but I have VSP now and decided to go to a place that accepted my insurance. This place is a ripoff.\n\nFirst off: Every office I have ever been to charges you for EITHER an eyeglass exam OR a contact lens exam. The contact exam costs more because it encompasses the eyeglass exam. Not this clever office. If you have contacts, they charge you for BOTH. This is the only place I have ever seen where they bill the eyeglass exam separate from the contact exam, thus resulting in two payments that you as the patient have to make.\n\nAnd the prices! $125 just for the eyeglass exam. Costco will charge you $65. An additional $75 for the contact exam. Costco charges $95 for the eyeglass AND contact exam combined. I did the math, the amount I ended up spending in co-payments at this office was HIGHER than just paying out of pocket for a contact exam at Costco and getting the measly refund insurance gives you when you go out-of-network. That's how big of a ripoff this place is. \n\nDon't even get me started on the prices for glasses and contacts. Basically anywhere else is cheaper. \n\nSecondly: As to the actual services I received. They are the only office I've ever seen that doesn't carry Acuvue brand. This wouldn't really be a problem, except the doctor came into the room and immediately started trying to get me to switch brands to Biofinity. I told her I really liked my Acuvue Oasys. She insisted Biofinity would be better. \n\nShe never actually checked my eyes with my Acuvue lenses to see if they properly fit me. Every eye exam I have ever had, the doctor has checked my eyes with the lenses in to make sure they still fit properly, even when I've said I'm happy with what I have. Not this doctor, she was too intent on peddling Biofinity to me. \n\nI told her I'd rather stick with Acuvue. She told me she'd like me to try Biofinity for 2 weeks and come back then. I agreed. I went home wearing a pair of Biofinity lenses. I'm sure they are great for some people, but they made my eyes dry and itchy.\n\nI returned 2 weeks later and told her I still like my Acuvue Oasys better. The doctor shrugged and wrote me a prescription for Oasys. Then the clerk came and tried to shoo me out the door. At that point I couldn't keep silent any longer and I asked her, \"Isn't the doctor going to actually check to see if the size of my Oasys is still correct? She never actually checked to see if the lenses I'm wearing still fit me.\" The clerk said it's not necessary because I was saying they still felt fine.\n\nSo, to recap, I was charged an addition $75 for a contact lens fitting, and the doctor never even checked to see if the contacts I was wearing properly fit me!! She wrote me a prescription without doing a single inspection of my contacts. \n\nSave yourself a lot of money and get waaaaay better customer service, go to the Costco Optometry. Or really, anywhere else.", "type": "review", "business_id": "0eW24T41olc6pqK4r9FKAw"}

When we notified our server, she was apologetic and had the sushi chef re-make our roll. But at that point it was hard to swallow anymore food. Not to mention, our server took forever in bringing us our bill. They were literally wiping down tables for closing, when I had to get up and seek her out to pay.

Served with the standard ranch dressing. For my meal, I went all the way and ordered the \"Vesuvius\". It is a burger with cheese in the middle. It had a little warning next to it. Heed the warning. My first bite into the sandwich was absolutely painful. Molten cheese came shooting out, and I felt like an idiot.

She said that she knew that this dinner was a total mess and that she wanted us to come back another night to try it again. I, of course, told her that was not necessary, but I appreciated the offer, but she insisted several times. That is how I found myself back there tonight. \n\nTonight's dinner was night and day different than the dinner we had two weeks ago. I know this may be slightly skewed since we had been asked back after having a not as good experience, but because of the nature of this restaurant (everyone gets the same food) I still think this experience was valid. \n\nThe patio continues to be beautiful, and tonight was a great night for the patio because it was cool, not cold, and the heaters were not necessary. The menu was a very good one, though not particularly suited to the husband and I (as we aren't generally fans of seafood and this menu was seafood heavy). Despite this, we enjoyed every bite of the meal. \n\nWe started with a lobster bisque. I was prepared not to like this, as I don't love lobster, but this was sooo good. Creamy, velvety, and not too fishy. It was served with a piece of toast that soaked up the broth...really good. Secondly, we had the same salad as the last time we were there....but it wasn't the same. It had the same components, but it was made correctly this time... last time it was just a piece of brie, with plain undressed arugula, plain nuts and a big piece of poached pear.... this time the salad was dressed perfectly, it had a thin slice of poached pear and a slice of poached apple and the brie was grilled (I think....)... it was so much better. For main dishes we had a filet topped with crab and a bearnaise sauce served with cheesy delicious potatoes, beets which were....beets, and nicely cooked asparagus and sea bass topped with cucumber and avocado served over red quinoa cooked with bacon, roasted carrots, and a delicious sauce (this was super flaky and delicious....the husband liked it better than the steak which is very unusual). Dessert was also tasty, it wasn't what it said it would be on the menu (was supposed to be chocolate espresso, but was a vanilla cake of sorts with several different yummy sauces like caramel and chocolate and served with fresh fruit...the best part? The nuts... really well toasted and added just the right amount of flavor). We weren't offered/didn't get coffee, but that was ok. Additionally, we had our dinner over 1.5 hours... I feel like that is an appropriate amount of time for a coursed dinner, so that was a great improvement. After this experience, I can see us giving this restaurant another chance... we will be back!\n\n\nPS After giving it some thought, I have concluded that the problem that we have experienced at this restaurant is largely due to communication. Had we been told there were issues in the kitchen and invited back another night from the beginning, that would have been acceptable (especially given the size of this operation and I do feel that it was not very fair that because of yelp we got a second shot but the other people there that night who most likely had the same experience probably didn't get the same treatment). Had we been informed at some point about menu changes, that would be ok too, but for some reason, things like this aren't disclosed at this restaurant. For example, the menu said chocolate dessert or pureed potatoes or whatever, if I were at a regular restaurant and ordered that, they would need to tell me, Oh I'm sorry, we've run out of that, but we do have something else. Why isn't that the case here? If there was one thing I think they should change, that would be it. Just a thought, but, as described, the food was far better last night and the follow up service was also very good, so they have that going for them", "type": "review", "business_id": "L-uPZxooP_ziXCtRrWi8Pw"}

The way it was told to me, it seemed to be a magical land where gods came down and cooked the perfect burger and sweet potato fries. So when a friend asked if I wanted to go there for lunch, with that mental picture, I readily agreed.\n\nWe got there around 6 or 7pm on a Saturday night. Now I am not sure if this is what it is always like, but the place seemed crazy busy. A few tables were being held for a reservation so my friends and I took seats to the side and ordered drinks while waiting for somewhere to open up. We had to wait for about 20 minutes for a table. I was parched and in that time, I believe the waitress refilled my drink 3 times. Even though it was busy, she was on the ball the whole time.\n\nWe sat down and quickly ordered, three burgers and a basket of sweet potato fries. The fries came out and here came my biggest complaint. They were a type of chili fries, not sweet potato. I don't know how the order was mixed up, but we thought since it was so busy/were all to easy going/lazy we weren't going to mention it. The fries were good, I was just sort of looking forward to the sweet potato fries. All was quickly forgiven when the burger came out. I could not get over how good this burger was.The mix of BBQ sauce, onions, and feta on top with pears on the bottom, my mouth is watering just thinking about it. There might have been more on this burger but I was to busy eating it and loving every second of my life at that point to really look too closely. I knew those review I had heard and mental picture I conjured were correct, this burger could not have been made by mortals.\n\nI look forward to my next trip here. Next time I go, which I hope is very soon, I will get those legendary fries, maybe try to get a look at those gods in that back that must make those amazing burgers.", "type": "review", "business_id": "EWMwV5V9BxNs_U6nNVMeqw"}

I looked up and saw Ken, his eyes glazed over, humming to his glass of iced Turkish coffee, a delight of his own creation. When Tony, the owner (along with his wife Juliette) came over to investigate, he decided he had to have one too.\n\n     This took place at Olive Tree Mediterranean Market and Grill in North Phoenix. Unlike most small groceries, Olive Tree is bright, clean and cheerful. The shelves are stocked with fascinating Middle Eastern delights - jars of olives and tahini, an interesting assortment of cheeses, sweet treats that I'd never seen before. You order at the counter   \nfrom a good size selection of ethnic dishes, plus a few typical American items. Food is then brought to your table in a sectioned off area.\n\n     I had discovered Olive Tree on Restaurant.com. Since we had to order $35 of food from the menu, we ended up with quite an array of dishes. Now that I think of it, the humming started with the above-mentioned baba. This roasted, pureed eggplant concoction is found in most Middle Eastern restaurants, with varying results. It can be very flat tasting if too much tahini (sesame paste) is mixed in, or it may be over-spiced. This baba was beautiful, with all the tastes dancing in our mouths. Julliette makes her own bread to go with it. The texture is very different from pita (even the pita served here was selected with great care), crustier and chewy. A special of the day was stuffed cabbage. About the same size and shape as the stuffed grape leaves (which were delicious), these are lighter and lemony good - a real treat. We shared a combination kebab plate with chicken, kefta, and shish-kebab skewers. This paled in comparison to the other dishes, since the meat was on the dry side. The baklava was quite good, it wasn't soggy with syrup, so the layers of phyllo dough made a satisfyingly crunchy noise.\n\n    After lunch we did a little shopping. We got some delicious feta cheese and something called Chicago cheese, which reminded me of mozzarella. I could have bought more, but Ken wisely herded me out the door.", "type": "review", "business_id": "zfY68t7nVihCwiCsCgM6cw"}

They also weren't as chatty/friendly/cool as BIlly, but oh well.  \n\nYou can stand by the bar if you're ready for a good time, or you can sit at one of their many tables/chairs if you want more of a relaxing night.

They moved and changed the name to Taco Loco: http://www.news-gazette.com/news/business/restaurants/2012-11-20/el-toro-urbana-moves-gets-new-name.html \nThe decor in this place still smells faintly of wet paint, and somewhat reminiscent of La Bamba in Champaign, if much brighter.  In the table, beneath the top layer, there appeared to be a footprint in the under layer.  Weird.\nThe waiter immediately asked us if we were ready to order, and when we said we needed more time, came over about every 2 minutes to ask if we were ready yet.  It wasn't \"Do you have any questions?\" or \"Can I help you find something to your tastes?\" but just \"Are you ready to order yet?\" every time.\nWe were brought chips and salsa and I ordered a bean dip to go with it.  The salsa was mediocre at best, and the bean dip was lukewarm and a soupy mix of queso and beans.  We were not brought appetizer plates, and so it was challenging to eat these without dripping.\nThe food came out unreasonably fast.  I can only imagine that they keep food in a warmer and not cooked to order, since food that comes out that fast should be HOT.\nI ordered the Quesadilla Roja with ground beef.  The plate contained a folded tortilla, scorched on the bottom, and filled with a ground beef that was a bland version of Taco Bell beef and a smidgen of queso.  The other half of the plate was filled with shredded lettuce, a half slice of underripe tomato, a generous dollop of sour cream, and a teaspoon, maybe, of what they call their \"Special Red Sauce,\" which seemed to be nothing more than chili powder added to tomato paste and thinned.  I had a pepsi with that which came in a glass with a crack in it.\nMy dining partner had a Burrito Loco, which was about a foot long, covered in cheese sauce, and came with as much rice.  He wasn't impressed, but I declined to taste it to compare.  He also ordered a margarita which had this tiny bit of salt on the rim, and he said it very sweet, but it didn't seem to have a noticeable amount of tequila in it.\nCompared to the time I dined at the old location, this is a very poor showing, and I will not be returning to give them a second chance, since the staff seemed marginally friendly, but indifferent at best.", "type": "review", "business_id": "1ZMcQNF-hHL0nJSnh5_a4w"}

Only other con was that the menu has so many options that you really should ask the wait staff to give you a few pointers in how much to order.

I walked over to the Maitre d' and politely asked why these groups were being seated while we were told we had to wait.  The maitre d' claimed I was told we would be seated at the next available table, but the placard on our table stated 8:45PM (i.e. 30 minutes from the time we arrived).  Under normal circumstances I would have left, but I was too hungry and the other dining options were less appealing.  We ordered the crab Rangoon appetizer for $6.99.  There was just an itty bitty smear of cream cheese in each (4) Rangoon and I would guess the closest any of them came to a crab was when the chef waved a crab claw over each.  It was therefore with much trepidation that we waited for our entrees of Singapore noodles and pad Thai to arrive.

Because the 8am tour was fully booked, I ended up on the 2pm tour. Got picked up at my hotel around 12:45. The staff were all very nice and helpful.\n\nThe pilots called us together a few minutes before 2pm to give us instructions for the flight. Tom and Charlie were very nice, very professional, and very gorgeous. That last part was definitely a nice bonus. The plane has seating that offers views for everyone and after the plane gets higher than 10,000 feet, Tom & Charlie invited us to visit them in their cockpit to take pictures. I was too scared to leave my seat during the trip going to the canyon, but did take advantage of the invitation on the return flight. Absolutely stunning views, especially because it was sunset by the time we headed back to Las Vegas. Tom & Charlie took pictures for me of the views and even took pictures with me. They were great in pointing out landmarks we could see outside of the windows.\n\nIn Tusayan, we were met by the tour bus operator, Marion. Besides the dry jokes, he was awesome! Gave clear instructions. We spent about an hour at Bright Angel Lodge and about 45 minutes at Mather Point. When you're intent on taking as many pictures of the canyon as I was, that 1 hr 45 min goes by rather quickly especially after stopping to eat some of the boxed lunch that's included in the tour.\n\nI would absolutely recommend the 2pm Explorers tour. You'll be able to take pictures pretty close to sunset which makes for awesome photographs. Definitely take a camera. Your cellphone just won't capture the Grand Canyon adequately.

The first time I went in to open my account, I was attended by this super cool gal and we chatted it up for a good while after talking account stuff and then realizing we had quite a bit in common.  Most recently when hubby and I went in for another in-person task, their banker, a latin gentleman (from the same country as my parents) attended us very well - we also ended up chatting it up for a bit after we all realized we had a lot in common.  I can honestly say these two people I point out here could easily be cool and good friends.  I guess all that goes to make you feel like they hire people like \"you and I\" and so that is comforting when you are giving Chase your business and your time.

All in all, a solid, well cooked and seasoned burger. The one thing that I really recommend is the garlic and herb fries. They were the stars of the entire meal. Of course, my breath was kicking after, but it was definitely worth it because they were that good. The sweet potato fries were also pretty nom.

Sadly, I did not go back after my friend left Luke and it was over 25 years since I last stepped foot into the place.

I went back last night.  WHY DID I STAY AWAY SO LONG!!  It has not changed from the way I remember it.  The service was first class, the food was out in less than 15 minutes, piping hot and was by far THE BEST Thai food I have had outside of Thailand - I have been in Thailand several times and eaten off the street vendors. The egg rolls were crispy and fresh and tasty and hot.   I had Thai spicy rice noodles with fresh basil and the flavor was amazing, it was fresh and dripping with flavors.  My son had the pad Thai and was in love.  The portions were large, and for two of us with full bellies it was $26 and some change.  I will be taking my wife there really soon.

The chip garnish was interesting, but I don't see how that plays in with the dish.  Superfluous...but not a negative.\n\nKorean kimchi hot dogs: was very intrigued by this menu item, but it was underwhelming.  It tasted exactly like a hot dog with bbq sauce.  Didn't get the sour punch from the kimchi, nor did I even notice pork belly in it.  The bun was very soft and delicious though.  \n\nGold standard burger: goat cheese cheddar was wonderful, and my burger was cooked to medium rare which is a plus.

Some of the sides, the carrots and potato options were very good actually. The salads were ok at best.\nI was at Jean Georges with a work group, maybe about 8 of us. We all had steaks which were overcooked. It wasn't enough to send it back for anyone, but they were all overcooked (I actually don't mind a medium steak being a bit overdone anyway). Food wise, I would say it was ok, but there are better options, especially at that price range.\n\nThe reason Jean Georges gets ONE STAR is because of the service/scam they tried to pull. We asked for a bottle of a dessert wine which was listed on the menu at about $60 which is the normal price for this wine. There was some confusion about the exact year/quality being ordered because the menu did not give the quality (these wines scored 3-7 by sweetness) but eventually the waitress found the wine and we confirmed it was what we expected. When the bill came, they tried to charge $250 for the wine, an OUTRAGEOUS price. \n\nWe told the waitress she made a mistake, she brought the menu back and made some story about how the wine we ordered was different from what was listed which was 1) entirely false and 2) we were never told that they thought it was a different wine. If a restaurant is under the impression they're serving a wine that's different from what's ordered, how can you serve that without telling anyone?! The waitress refused to be reasonable so we asked to talk to the manager. After a great deal of arguing, the manager seemed to imply the menu was wrong and insisted on the $250 price. Eventually the manager simply gave up and charged us the correct $60 price, but, firstly, you should be comping a $60 dessert wine on an 8 person meal over $1,000 anyway! And after such an ordeal, good service says to comp the wine then! \n\nWe all left feeling frustrated and insulted.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Hieqsu3u1peZ2I2jPwiKHw"}

There's something weirdly charming about Homme.  Not sure if it's the cheap drinks, the crowd, the converted two-story house layout, the Central Phoenix club circuit regulars, or the fact that it's constantly evolving -- adding DJs/nights seemingly all the time.  \n\nI went here the other night for Friday's relocated French Kiss newwave/indie/punk/electro dance party and have to say it was a blast.  I had been here a few times before - once on a Thursday night with Bonnie, once for Tuesday night karaoke, and even when it was a creepy old fogey gay bar a few years ago.\n\nThe space is just right for the dance party, and the upstairs DJ/dancefloor area lends itself well to those who are seeking an added bonus - in this case, deep house.  The decor here is OK, nothing special, really - although it is more brightly lit, and brightly painted than it used to be.  Lots of nooks and crannies here and an intimidating narrow spiral staircase, which is good if you get bored with conventional spaces.\n\nThe crowd is diverse (gay, straight, black, white, brown, whatevs) and depending on the night it's crawling with hipsters, club kids and electro/new wave/indie/tribal/house/breakbeat aficionados.  These are the types of people who go somewhere for the music and could give an eff about anything else.  With the clientele and music selection, Homme has the feel of a more cosmopolitan LA/SF dance club, but without the attitude.\n\nHomme will be seeing more of Stevey, no doubt.", "type": "review", "business_id": "yPpPJyAF8pciHnhTF-C38w"}

It is definitely a great space which is decorated beautifully. Our waiter was a bit curt, and I have to say that I agree with the other reviews on here, that he was definitely trying to get us to spend more money than we wanted to. The way that he described the salads that they offered was also confusing. We thought we would be receiving  a house salad with our meal when we decided not to go with the pricey parma or caesar salads that were being pushed upon us. Though we never received a salad and when we informed him that we were disappointed, and found his earlier explanation to be a bit confusing and misleading, he acted as if our assumptions were unfounded. I order some coffee before dinner, since the delicious aroma from it was wafting through the restaurant. A french press was brought to the table and poured for me, but my cup was filled with coffee grounds. When we told the waiter, he seemed annoyed and said that he would bring another, but because of the french press, it would probably happen again. The second cup only had a couple floating around, which was reasonable, and the coffee was bold and delicious. We ordered the arancini for an appetizer, and it was quite good, though we would have preferred it to be hot instead of just luke warm. After hearing from a couple of people, including one of our dinner companions, that the lobster raviolis were delicious, we decided to try them for dinner.  While they were good, we didn't feel that they lived up to their expectations. The brown butter sauce they came in was unfortunately a bit watered down. We told our waiter and he again seemed annoyed, though when we left the restaurant, we did tell the manager, and he seemed genuinely concerned. We had the bread pudding for dessert and it was out of this world! One of the best desserts that I have had in a long while. It was warm and moist and the caramel sauce is heavenly. I would go back to this restaurant just for this dessert! I think we will try this restaurant again in the future, and if it disappoints again, then at least we will know that we will have a phenomenal dessert to end the meal with!", "type": "review", "business_id": "5NcgSVx0fJFYManZSJyRQA"}

This restaurant is far from fabulous, not 4 A's as described in the column. Not even close! The food arrived cold, the brisket was more fat than meat and not very tender, the ribs were dry and unappealing; the mac and cheese side was bland and had not a taste of cheese; one of my dining companions sent his brisket back in exchange for the pulled pork but, after arriving looking like half a football, it too was sent back. The waiter was pleasant enough and sent an assistant manager who advised he'd get some less fatty brisket. This 3rd replacement was better with less fat. My complaint to the general manager was handled very poorly with no accommodation.  This was followed with a complaint to the chef - owner who responded with no emotion.

If you didn't know what you were looking for (and if your attention isn't caught by the tree branch square root sign) you may well never know this place existed.  And your life would be all the poorer for your ignorance.  The d\u00e9cor inside is warm, but not extravagant.  Wooden benches, soft lighting, walls the color of a lighter shade of wood but most definitely not wooden, etc.  Artsy pictures of leaves and the like adorn the walls.  The overall atmosphere is comfortable and unremarkable, but some how grander than all of its individual components.  My party consisted of three people including myself, so we ordered three appetizers and three entrees.  \n\nThe appetizers (Brussels sprouts, duck testicles, bone marrow cr\u00e8me brulee):\n\nAh the ever-popular crispy brussels sprouts with the bacon and black pepper glaze.  The brussels sprouts weren't very crispy, but the glaze was fantastic.  Sweet, savory, and rich, though not very bacony.  The brussels sprouts were also cooked perfectly inside.  A solid and very tasty appetizer, though honestly nothing too too special.\n\nNext were the duck testicles.  I thought the sauce on the testicles themselves was a bit too peppery (not too spicy, too peppery), but it was complimented very nicely by the dill buttermilk and mint sauce.  Seriously, that dill buttermilk is a stroke of genius.  The testicles have a very interesting, almost gamey flavor to them, and are mushy in terms of texture.  The carrot and celery salad that accompanied it was literally just slices of carrot and celery.  Not particularly interesting, flavorful, or inspired.  Having said that, they did provide a nice crunch, and a bit of brightness to every bite.  Worth trying if you have the balls.\n\nFinally, came the bone marrow cr\u00e8me brulee.  The predominant flavors were egg and parmesan with the bone marrow being virtually undetectable.  The brulee itself was honestly a bit bland, but paired very nicely with the tart green apple gremolta.  \n\nThe entrees (pork belly banh mi, wagyu steak [special of the day], pork heart sausage):\n\nThe banh mi was a deconstructed sprawl separated into three equivalent portions.  Each portion had a slab of pork belly, crostini, a generous helping of duck liver mousse, pureed kimchi, mint sauce, pickled carrots, and radishes.  My pork belly was a bit overcooked though one of my fellow diners (whose taste I trust) insisted his was cooked pretty well.  The pureed kimchi was interesting though unrecognizable as kimchi.  The duck liver was exquisite: rich, fatty, and very very flavorful.  The pickled carrots also provided a wonderful contrast to all the rich flavors.  My only complaint were the radishes which I felt added little to the plate.\n\nThe wagyu beef our server recommended ordering medium-rare.  It was served with black rice, stir-fried kimchi, a five-minute egg, and pickled cabbages.  The rice and veggies were immaculate.  The kimchi paired very well with the smokiness of the steak, and the pickled cabbages just set off the rest of the dish perfectly.  Unfortunately, the steak itself, while well-seasoned and quite flavorful, was a bit tough.  The slivers of peanut mixed in with the rice though, were also delicious and complemented the flavors present quite well.\n\nFinally came the pork heart sausage with polenta, what seemed to be fried kale, cherry tomatoes, and feta.  The sausage itself was a bit salty for our taste, but the flavor and aroma of the bits of heart were lovely.  The polenta was rich, savory, creamy, and amazing.  The fried kale as well, particularly taken in the context of the dish as a whole, worked very well to add some crunch and herbaceousness.  The cherry tomatoes provided a bit of tartness which undercut and balanced out the richness of the dish.  The feta provided another textural contrast but for the most part was drowned out by the other flavors except when I got a particularly big piece where it pushed the saltiness of that bite too far.  \n\nNotice a pattern?  In every dish there was at least one component that would have benefited from better execution, but its individual flaws were mitigated by the other parts of the dish and each one holistically was more or less successful.  Overall, I'd say this is definitely a restaurant worth visiting, and even revisting.  3.75/5", "type": "review", "business_id": "TJo0LRUmc9Y1J05dM6fqiw"}

You will notice most of the bad reviews come from previous patrons or maybe workers.  That is how I feel, and they are bias in my view because people do not like change.\n\nSo my real rating from some one who was told about this place. I would give this more of a 3.5 rating cause it better than average for a local bar. Your get a sports bar feel from the pool tables, shuffle boards, sports games playing. Friday night and Saturday night are the \"busy\" nights. They run Karaoke on those nights but I cant fully call it a karaoke bar cause its not ever night.  Only been there one time on a Friday night went by my self cause I enjoy karaoke. I feel its more of a neighborhood bar, its not a dance club and pick up ladies bar. It feels like regulars and some of there friend hanging out enjoying karaoke. Its a great spot for friends to hag out for sure. Song selection was decent give it a 4/5. I am used to having any song I want to sing with my friend who host Karaoke on other nights so I am spoiled. \n\n As far as the service, I was at the karaoke book for about 2-3 min bye the karaoke host station so no waitress noticed me.  That is understandable, I am alone and could be with a group since I was at the host table. I then decided to sit at the bar. The Woman/Bartender did not seem to notice me at first, she was washing dishes for about 1-2 min. Not a big deal, but I feel you should acknowledge the person and say I will be right with you if your gonna continue doing dishes. Then she came over after she was done, she smiled and politely asked what I wanted. I told I wanted my usual Southern Comfort and Sprite. She got it right away. Then asked if I wanted to pay cash or start a tab. I said ill start a tab. Then she asked, \"may I steal a card from you\" I dont like this phrase at all in a professional sense.  Even though I disliked it I was quite and I handed her my card respectfully and she then put the card on the back table with my name I assume attached to it.  Now here is what I dislike the most. I was never told her name there was no introduction it was just what would you like and give me your card pretty much. So I gave her my precious Credit Card and I don't know her. . .I have previous bar tending experience, I feel its like greeting some one for the first time you say hello ask there name and tell them yours and make them feel welcome. A smile and fast service is nice, but a warm welcome and a new friend is better. I honestly feel it was not that busy because it was only like 930ish and maybe 8 people at the bar.  If you want to make new customers and longer patrons my advice is tell them your name say it a couple times so they don't have to yell or scream \"hey Miss\" or \"Hey Bartender\" Cause I know that pissed me off when I worked. I am trying to help these are little things that can make a huge difference in service and repeat customers. So in terms of service I would give it a 2.5/5 totally average nothing special.\n\nSo on the drinks that is what people come out for to get good drinks and food depending. I have too say my first drink was average on pour, the second one tasted like a double. So over all I would say that is good 4/5 easily she knew how to make drinks and was very fast. Not sure if she meant to make the second one stronger but I could see the Dark amber color in mixed with the sprite on the second drink so it was good pour for sure. I only had 2 drinks I had a 9$ tab + 3$tip included I feel the service was decent enough for it it could of been better I do not find great bartenders any more honestly. \n\nSo finally to the Crowd at Cheers. I sang 2 songs both time they clapped and some Women with there Husband or Significant other. Complemented me on how well of a job I did. I know I have a good voice not star material by any means but I love music. The total Crowd was nice and pleasant, other than one gentleman who could of passed off for a hard core biker guy with his leather jacket and tattoos stated' \"How does it feel to be gay.\"  I did not take offence at all I just smiled and said,\" You are not the first to ask if I was gay or even say a comment like that.\" he chuckled \"not the first, really?!?\" Then I stated, \"Being gay is not a bad thing. I am not gay and I feel some women prefer a sensitive type. I sing songs about love or that women appeal to because its a great way to pick them up.\" He laughed and I finished signing my tab I stated, \"enjoy your night sir, maybe you should try and sing too\" and I walked out. LMAO  I love dive bars would I go again sure but I need friend to make me stay longer than 2 hours lol", "type": "review", "business_id": "kuGQG_8i9P-4p9_Mym-G8Q"}

I. Love. Goldman's. This review is an update, it's been about two years since I first discovered Goldman's Deli. I was hesitant to jump on the Goldman's bandwagon at first, thankfully, things have changed. I eat at Goldman's about once a week. \n\nThere are three major things that make Goldman's wonderful: \n1. They are family owned and operated, Mrs. Goldman is so sweet, she recognizes her regular patrons and knows them by name. The staff is always helpful and friendly. \n2. The food is fantastic and fresh\n3. It is always impeccably clean \n\nTheir soup is amazing, it's always so difficult to choose just one (I strongly suggest the matzo ball, or sweet and sour cabbage!) I know that people love their Borscht. Their sandwiches are to die for, I'm obsessed with their turkey pastrami, boyfriend loves their Ruben's. Their baked goods are delicious, take home a multi-pack of their Rugulach. I usually get the same thing when I go to Goldman's, half a  turkey pastrami sandwich on rye, with a cup of soup (even though I always want to get a bowl.) I always leave happy and full and so will you. \n\nThe only reason I won't give Goldman's five stars is because their prices are quite high (not unusual for a deli restaurant) and the portions are not as large as most deli's, therefore, I don't think that the prices are reasonable. Also, they will nickel and dime you over small things (like charging for pickles) or charging for butter.  Also, they don't make their own pickles...even Chompie's (gross) makes their own pickles! But, I can forgive Goldman's for their high prices and pathetic pickles. I suggest this place to everyone that will listen. I feel like a deli pusher.  Delicious!", "type": "review", "business_id": "TpQMR-JFE5V0UPzTjjuwFQ"}

The location is pretty good since it's right next to the strip, but the area isn't so great. The second Don stepped out of his car, some homeless man approached him and started talking about how his brake lights are out. Then that little comment turned into a whole talk about how his wife is pregnant and sick, blah blah blah. Of course, it all ended with the guy asking Don for some money. Once he walked away, we checked the brake lights and they were fine. I guess it's just another tactic people are using so it could seem like they're helping you out, so you should give them something in return. \n\nAnyways, about this Starbucks. The location is okay. I didn't have any problem with traffic at all or getting into the parking lot. Since there were only a few customers there, we were able to find a table right away. It wasn't just any table either, it was one right next to a couple outlets for us to use! Woohoo. I ordered the Awake hot tea and Don ordered Calm hot tea. At other Starbucks locations, the Awake that I'd get would have me feeling pretty cracked out and unable to sleep, but it didn't do anything for me at all here. I actually felt like I was getting more tired. I don't see how that could be their fault though since the tea comes in containers and they don't have to do any sort of ingredients mixing at all to make it. \n\nTips:\n*If you have the option, come at night.

When a place gets real popular, parking is always a battle! Parking tip: Right next to Tea Station, behind the east side wall, is Harbor Palace (stay tunes for a review!), is some parking and you can walk right on over to Tea Station no problem! Once you've won the battle of parking, you'll walk in and often times, especially after 8pm, the tables are taken and crowded-- exactly what happens when I wear skinny jeans: TIGHT! They offer a discount of 30% off when you take your drinks to go (good business move and idea!) so take advantage of it if you don't have a party to entertain. Take your drinks and take a stroll on the strip that isn't too far away from Tea Station. If you decide to ignore the 30% discount and stay, grab a deck of cards to entertain yourself while the Asian \"baristas\" throw your drink together.\n\nI came here a few times and a few bad experiences with the service. The waiter tends to get your order wrong if you don't explain clearly what you want or point to the menu.  Should I fail this place in my book if I've grown numb to the bad service I get here sometimes? I'm not the only who's said the same thing, but then again the drinks are the best boba drinks I've tasted here in Las Vegas. Sigh... What a love/hate relationship! What am I talking about again?!

It was a good-sized portion for a starter salad. \n\nI opted for the Spaghetti Squash Casserole with fresh mozzarella and tomatoes. I love it and saved the rest for lunch! My handsome dining partner tried the Natural Pan Roaster Chicken with asparagus, fennel, and farro. It was drizzled with a light sauce and was very tasty. The chicken was cooked to perfection. \n\nSo believe it or not, we had room for dessert and tried the Apple-Cranberry Crumble with dairy-free maple flavor ice cream. I should have skipped the salad and had two of these! We also tried the Lemon Cake with Strawberries and Greek Yogurt. That was also pretty good but then again I usually never disagree with dessert. \n\nOther than the awesome food, the service was friendly and attentive. I love the decor as well. True Food Kitchen has an open floor plan (that never seems too loud) and a nice patio. \n\nI would highly recommend! I've dined at True Food several times and have always left satisfied. On other visits, I've tried a variety of their cocktails and enjoyed them. The Teriyaki Brown Rice with Asian Veggies is also great!", "type": "review", "business_id": "qjmCVYkwP-HDa35jwYucbQ"}

The only thing I have seen change throughout time is the people on the counter.  Other than that, food and service has been consistent.\n\nIt is a NY based Chinese restaurant, but not the type that fancies itself.  From reading most reviews, people who see this place expect it to be a fusion of Panda Express and Pei Wei.  It's not.  People should stop thinking that Pei Wei and Panda Express is real asian food, and when something like this comes along, they claim to be an expert on how chinese food should taste like.\n\nFor those who aren't from the East Coast, let me learn you something.  NY Chinese food is considered Street Food.  It is supposed to be cheap and quick.  The taste isn't supposed to taste like it took hours to prepare, or even something that health nuts expect out of beef and chicken.  It's supposed to be dirty with a hint of flavor, thats how Street Food is.  Cheap and Quick.  \n\nProblem here is, these guys may be from NY, but just like all the other \"NY based\" restaurants, they have to uphold the norm in the city they are in.  Scottsdale isn't a cheap place, nor a cultured place for that matter.  So to actually market themselves as a NY Authentic Restaurant isn't going to work much around here.  \n\nAnyways, aside from that little personal rant ...  Service has always been good.  I usually phone them so by the time I get there, food is ready.  The people on the counter has always been helpful.  Sorry for people who get annoyed for their bad service, you can't be helped while the person is on the phone taking care of another customer.\n\nI'm not going to rave about how great the food tastes.  If you are from the East Coast (NY / NJ / MA) then you can expect a similar taste to that style and cooking.  If you aren't from there, then you oughta give this place a chance.  Just like every new restaurant that opens, come in and give it a try with an OPEN mind.... and if you have money of course.\n\nMy gripe with the store is that they sold out.  Yes it may have similar tastes to the restaurants back home, but they sold out to try to fit the norm of Scottsdale.  Prices have risen for no apparent reason.  Fried Rice is close to $7 taxed!  That is an outrage.  I think they should take off the NY AUTHENTIC scheme and just go with a bland ARIZONA CHINESE RESTAURANT title, because that is what is has succumb to.", "type": "review", "business_id": "simnCuMX4OVwIhWaIqL4zA"}

I had been working at T in the Park all weekend and found out that there were in fact no Citylink buses going back to the 'Gow. So along with a girl I'd met at the weekend and some young drunken recruit we found lost on Princes St, we three went in search of a bed.\n\nLet me tell you, I could've cried I was so sleepy. So that mattress could've been made from metal and it would still have been the greatest sleep I've ever had. But regardless of the bizarre circumstance and my bleary, blootered state I still noticed how fun the place was. For a start, when we staggered in at sunrise the guy at reception was dancing to Kajagoogoo and other obscure 80s one hit wonders such as Love and Pride, followed by a portion of Duran Duran. He was spinning around like Kylie and barely noticed us, but was very excitable when he saw us. He led us to our rooms and had so much enthusiasm at that time in the morning that I felt like I was in Wonderland, or someone had spiked my drink and I was hallucinating.\n\nThe 80s dancing dude gets an instant 4 stars, but I noticed that the hostel was clean, had lots of facilities and the dorms were very spacious. It was also cheap enough (15 pounds for a night) especially being so centrally located. For people further afield, this place is a dream. Americans would cream themselves - it's got windy staircases, low ceilings and looks like an annexe of Hogwarts. Because there are so many buildings like that in the UK some Brits can be harder to impress than people who don't have these wee magical coves, but I appreciate that the building is over 400 years old and carries a musty smell while also being very tidy. \n\nWeary, drenched and drunk, coming here was an accident but was a memorable start to a mad birthday!", "type": "review", "business_id": "DKT6xzZZamY0m89lPfpnnA"}

This place has so many bad aspects, but yet so many great ones as well.\n\nService in the bar area is downright terrible. It's as if Mi Casa only hires bartenders and cocktail servers with below average time management skills. This is especially obvious during happy hour when you can almost see the shock on the bartenders' faces when the foot traffic starts to pick up. Mi Casa has amazing margaritas and great prices on those margaritas. The trick is simply getting one in your hands. It's going to take a while. Especially during happy hour. This applies to the servers in the bar area as well. Once you actually get one to wait on you I would recommend ordering multiple drinks. I have no doubt you'll be pleased with the quality of your beverage, but you never know when you'll be getting another. The servers always seem more overwhelmed than the bartenders do. \n\nBeing sat in the dining room always confuses me as well. You could walk up to the hostess and you can literally count maybe 4 or 5 tables of patrons, however the hostless always says the wait will be between 20-45 minutes.

Also, they have fresh cut fruit, sushi, and roast beef. \n\nThe reason I am also giving this location 4 stars is because of the service and the attention I received. After a little situation I encountered, I had a manager named Abbie come to my table. She resolved my issue and complaint quickly and effectively. She was so courteous and professional on top of that. After everything, she just made things better and I left the buffet happy. We are staying at the MGM hotel this week and I'm sure I'll come back tomorrow for dinner once again with my family.\n\nPS. I would suggest going for dinner and not lunch.

My husband and I ordered delivery from Red Tea House on a friday night for dinner. He was fasting for Orthodox Christmas so he ordered Tofu in the general tso's sauce. I decided to try the beef in garlic sauce and we also had edamame. We both noted that the prices seemed a little steep but we were hoping it was because the food was amazing like the other reviewers noted. The delivery arrived by the time quoted and contained our entire order. First, we tried the edamame. We are both huge edamame fans and you can't really get edamame wrong, right? Wrong. Half the edamame wasn't completely cooked and was hard. Next, for my beef with garlic sauce, I was surprised that the beef was in strips. I'm talking like the width of shoe strings and although the menu description did not note vegetables, the container was full of onions and peppers. In fact, the dish was mostly veggies with a side of beef. I was also surprised by the level of spice in my dish. The menu does note that the dish is spicy but I usually ignore the spicy sign because I love spicy dishes and most dishes that say they are spicy I consider mild. Well they were not lying about being spicy. I could only eat about 10 bites before I had to stop because my mouth was on fire. Not complaining because again, I love the spicy but, important to note when ordering a spicy dish, they mean business. I also spent the extra dollar to get the fried rice. This was also a mistake as the rice was cooked with some soy sauce and egg. No veggies, no pork, no flavor. My husband did enjoy the general tso's sauce and thought it had a good balance of tang and sweet. If we go back, maybe next time we'll try the sushi.", "type": "review", "business_id": "jCyRkEpj7ma4xsZ9jyR5uQ"}

At least with many other car issues we take care of it in advance by changing the oil or something, but the lowly tire? Not so much.\n\nDiscount Tire seems to be interested in changing that, and by that I mean that they are not just interested in changing your tire (though they surely are), but they are also interested in changing the approach to your tires. Not just once, not twice, but three times - on two different vehicles - I have come in and they have checked out the problem with low tire pressure and fixed it. For no cost.\n\nOnce they even removed the tire from the rim, took out a screw, fixed the flat and put it all back together. Impressive. Now I could complain that it took a while, and it wasn't the fastest service in the world - but there were paying customers, so I can't complain all that much. Still, it is the only reason I would hesitate slightly to give that fifth star at this point. I can say that the next time I need tires (for real tires, not just a check-up), they are first on the list, and that will likely earn them that last star.", "type": "review", "business_id": "UTX2R-9DyI82Jrv6VEka4w"}

Yes, I said it! The Oyster Bar may just be the best kept secret in Sin City. I have been coming here for over 10 years and the food is AMAZING. When I started coming here there was never a line but now you will have to probably have to wait at least an hour to get seated. So my advice to you all is to get here right when it opens or you'll be waiting for a while especially during the weekend. These New Orleans Chefs are Freaking Hilarious....Bob (noon shift) and JJ (night shift). They will have you rolling the whole time. I always start off with a dozen Oysters. They have the freshest oysters in town and I guarantee that it will melt in your mouth. I have tried everything on the menu. So here are my recommendations:\n\n#1 Bouillabaisse - My all time FAVORITE. This is a classic french dish made with tomato, saffron, wine, garlic, leeks, and seafood including crab, cod, prawns, lobster, mussels, and clams. Since, I am naturally HOT, I get my Bouillabaisse at a spicy level of 7. \n#2 Palace Pan Roast is their top selling dish. \n#3 House Gumbo - Tasty Creole chowder with seafood, sausage, and okra. \n#4 Linguini with Shrimp Scampi - Made to perfection.\n\nThe price ranges from $15-$22. You have the option to have rice or linguini (extra charge) with your soup. Also, they will ask you how spicy you want it. So choose your number wisely! If you ordering a frosty beverage make sure to keep the glass. The next time you come back and trust you'll be back... the beer will be 1/2 price.  I have tried all these dishes but I am truly in love with my Bouillabaisse.

Their beer line up is always stellar and they are incredible at partnering with the community, but my meal (meatloaf and taters) was cold and lacked flavor. I really wanted to catch the attention of our server, but I think her section was large and it was a while before she came back to check in. \n\nWhen I left that night I was a tad discouraged, but oddly when I reheated the leftovers, they were better. Maybe I just need to grab take-out and make my way back to Madison with their grub? Maybe I'm not ordering the right things?", "type": "review", "business_id": "j7GDzt9TfD87_JWJy9eI4Q"}

First off, the service was the best I've ever received.  When we approached the hostess station, we were greeted by name before we even had a chance to say anything.  Throughout the evening, we were addressed by name. You even get a fresh napkin when you return to your seat. Although the service was incredible, it was a bit over the top for me.\n\nI got the Short Story tasting menu.  My bf wanted the Journey, but the waiter said it wasn't available at that time.  Instead, he asked what my bf wanted in particular from that menu, and we got those courses!  The food was good(I'm a picky eater and working on that).  My favorites were the Squash Puree, and the buffalo tenderloin was the best meat I've ever had.  My bf loved all his courses.  He was also satisfied w/his wine pairings.  He thought some were ok, some were interesting, and others were outstanding.  The portions were generous, especially when compared to Binkley's.  I was on the verge of bursting by the end.\n\nAnother thing I liked about this place was that they tried to use local foods.  For example, the olive oil was grown on the reservation and pressed at Queen Creek Olive Mill.\n\nI hope to return one day for the buffalo.  I prefer Binkley's since you can choose anything you want for the tasting menu and it's a bit more casual.", "type": "review", "business_id": "T9iBSa4pxYXP129pHlt5Sg"}

My only complaint is that their servings are huge - they say it feeds one person, claiming it's a single serving. Yea, it's a single serving -- for TWO people.\n\nI'm currently loving their new selection of pastas and sauces. They've added in chicken masala in their prepackaged meals. I still find their butter chicken a bit on the bland to flavorless side. How I wish they would bring their chicken tikka masala from the UK.\n\nThe one that prevents me from giving them 5 stars is the nature of their dishes with rice - there is usually more rice than say, chili, as an example. I end up wasting food and I can't stand doing that. They are always generous with the rice but never the main part of the dish. I'd like more mango chicken with my rice, plzkthx! Are you listening F&E?\n\nI'm not too fond of their chicken or carne asada burritos. I don't know if it's the spicing, but for me it seems a bit off - and they tend to contain too much rice and beans for me. Maybe if someone tries their burritos, they can tell me.\n\nTheir desserts are decent, but again, they're not single serve items. They are far too big for it. I eat a \"single serving\" of tres leches cake in 4 days.\n\nI do find bargains in the fruit that's about to expire. I feel that paying $3+ for pre-cut fruit in a small-ish plastic container a bit much. I go on the day/day before that the fruit is to expire and purchase it for $1.40 - the cheapest I scored it for was $.75 and it lasted 5 days past the due date. Sorry, leftover college day moments there.  DOH. Plus, I'm lazy as all f*ck about cutting up my own fruit.\n\nI'll be updating as F&E starts unveling new products for me to taste.", "type": "review", "business_id": "cIAE5XY3cuUs8_Vx_QKO8Q"}

The hostess was very nice and asked how we heard about Poppy Den and once I said Yelp, she asked if I was an Elite. I would give an extra star just because she knew what yelp was. \n\nThe only hiccup was that they couldn't ifnd a happy hour menu so we had to wait about 5 minutes to find one. \n\nI had the Bellini champagne cocktail, I originally thought the waiter only brought us champagne, but he explained that the peach flavoring is added in and they don't use a juice like a mimosa would look. It tasted fresh and crisp. The only downside is that I am a slow drinker and it warmed up in the patio area, so the cocktail became room temperature. \n\nThe food was unique, I enjoyed the watermelon salad, caprese salad (another slice of tomato and mozzarella wouldn't hurt), and the chicken wings were scrumptious. The chicken wings had this delicous crust around the chicken meat and then was drizzled in a spicy and sweet asian sauce. If I was dining alone, I could have had the salads and the chicken and make an entire meal. \n\nThe potstickers were fine, and the meatballs were mushy, nothing special. \n\nFrom the regular menu we had the tomato soup, it had a light sweetness to it once it hit your tongue, which then transcended into a light heat. I also got to try the crabcakes, yes they are small, but man are they packed with crab. Chef sosa made a good choice to go with quality over quantity here, and the pickled asian apple pear was a very nice light and refreshing touch to something that is usually so heavy. \n\nFor dessert they were out of the fortune cookie with mango sorbet so we ended up getting the trio of sorbets. The sorbets were very tasty, but the waiter said that we had mango, strawberry, and pineapple ginger. I couldn't taste the ginger, and it tasted more like a pineapple coconut sorbet. The flavors were intense, but not sweet! The cookie bowl that it came in was a delite to munch through and acted as a great tool to move the sorbet into the mouth. \n\nService was great, our waiter came to check on us quite often and didn't make a big deal that one party member was 90 minutes late. Our water glasses were always full, and came right away with a dessert menu and offered suggestions and was very knowledgable about the menu.", "type": "review", "business_id": "uBcUz2Jnqu5OzXnuAWaJew"}

We were able to park quickly and when we walked in a very friendly lady took our order. We ordered some hot wings and  their Super Pizza. We sat down and enjoyed some conversation and the football game on the television. About 10 minutes later the lady who took our order brought out a basket of hot wings and said they threw in a couple extra because there were some small ones in the mix. As far as we could tell, there weren't ANY smalls one in the mix. She also brough out ample sides of ranch and bleu cheese that obviously did not come out of a big jug of random brand salad dressing. These dressings were fresh and tasted as if they were made in house. As we greedily munched away a few minutes later our pizza came out. Now I can tell you as a carb starved big girl, the crust was very important to me...and they nailed it! Perfectly crispy on the bottom and light and fluffy in the center. The toppings were abundant and the cheese was real and fantastic. \nAs hard as we tried to demolish this beast we could only barely gobble down half of the pizza. The rest was neatly boxed up by the nice lady who took care of us the whole way. We complimented the food and she was humble and flattered and invited us to come back whenever we are on that side of town. It's a small mom and pop place with the whole family working on a Sunday. It's nice to see a locally owned business putting out a good product and backing it up with excellent customer service. \nWe will definitely come back and visit as we hear they have a killer cheesesteak and not only that...they have fried pickles.

The selection is limited and I think the price is misrepresented.  I would probably put it at least at $$.  For a simple tuna sandwich and a medium drink to put me back almost $11 without any sides.  For $6.50 I thought, this sandwich had better be amazing.  It was meh.  New flavors and combos with the tuna salad that I hadn't really thought of before, including diced carrots? Strange, but the flavors were interesting.  Sweeter than I would have liked.  I'm more of a savory lover.  All in all, I was not that impressed with the food and the price.

All 13 women were pleased with the meal they ordered - no small feat!\nThe wait staff worked hard to get everything right and were very pleasant, as well.\nWe noticed that, as the sun went down, the patio got VERY dark - there was really no extra lighting out there. \nAlso, when you are seated close to the open door leading to the inside, the blowing fan was so loud it was very annoying. Luckily, if you just move away from the door it quiets down quickly (but unfortunately it gets darker).\nWent back Saturday night with hubby. Went out to patio. Once again, very dark. Pretty empty, people smoking, really no ambiance, although it was such a beautiful night. Also, competing music with stereo system and live music at neighboring sushi bar.\nWaitress was VERY friendly! \nFood was EXCELLENT! We ordered a pizza that was so good and the side salads were huge. Again - nice wine selection for a pub atmosphere.\nSo - if you want good food and friendly service, this is the place. If you are looking for nightlife or ambiance, PHG needs to work a little harder.\nthis could be a seriously fun, popular venue for all age groups.

Started off with some pasta. I love me some pasta. I got the tortellini and noticed they had a made-to-order pasta station. Oooooooh! There was a line so I decided to come back. Let's just say that tortellini and the cocktail shrimps were the best of the entire buffet. The ravioli I got at the pasta station after tasted like shit. They only had 2 soup choices where other buffets have at least 4. The corn on the cob was so soggy and greasy. The selection at the Wynn buffet is so minimal. There wasn't much to eat. \n\nNot to mention that the plates weren't all fully cleaned. I came across two plates my entire meal that had specks of sauce on it still. I left still hungry.

They were lowered further by the atmosphere/decor. This chain restaurant is indeed offensive on many levels to a person from Chicago: typical corporate chain restaurant wall flair is everywhere, and that schlock is indeed Chicago themed. There is a scoreboard that looks like Wrigley's, a sign for Rush Street, and everywhere you look are old timey pics of landmarks etc. etc. This in and of itself would not be so bad, but the fact that the chain so buttfucks the idea of Chicago deep dish pizza is irredeemable. The thing that they call deep dish likely has most of the ingredient groups of a Chicago Style pizza, but it is so unlike a Chicago Style pizza I refuse to discuss it anymore for fear I will throw my keyboard in rage. A quick look at their corporate website and you will note that this place has dozens, if not hundreds of locations, with only one in Chicagoland (Elk Grove, on the Iowa side of O'Hare).\n\nSo why does this patently offensive joint get an 'A-OK'? The thin crust pizza was pretty good. It was not New York Style, but the cheese had the same saltiness and was cooked to perfection: crispy, with slightly orange cheese, and served hot as hell but not yet burnt. I had it with basil and roasted garlic, which were chopped up and added under the cheese and complimented the pizza very well. Their Cheesy Garlic bread is absolutely divine; I have to get that again next time. \n\nThey also have beer. Basically every mainstream domestic and popular import you have ever heard of. About 30 on tap. Not as many obscure micros and craft beers as you will find at the Pig and Crane Alley or even at Radio Maria, Boltini and Seven Saints, but it is a great selection for a chain restaurant. Kinda disappointing in that regard, but understandable as this is obviously a company that buys thousands, if not millions of barrels yearly and is not interested in getting a cask here and there.\n\nI went on Tuesday night, when they have 1/2 price pizzas and $2.99 Two Brothers' Beers. This made the meal much more palatable. My 14\" thin crust pizza full price would have been about $15-16 with 2 toppings, which is a little much for a pizza that feeds two (they say 2-3, but dont do that to yourself). \n\nService was great. Jacob (Jake) was attentive, efficient, and accurate. He was courteous and intuited our needs. We were playing trivia there via the NTN boxes, so of course he always seemed to come by when a question was being asked, but that is just how life seems to work.\n\nThey have a ton of TVs, most of which are flatscreen HD. They also have a bunch of very high quality video games including new golden tee and new safari hunter as well as a few others. This would be an excellent place to watch a game.\n\nSo, the experience was pretty darn good, even if it was in an obnoxious corporate atmosphere. Prices would have been a little higher than is reasonable for Chambana, but I went on a night with a deal (check their website for that). Had a talented server, and that made all the difference.", "type": "review", "business_id": "zO0xbqEznVuzPl54RExymg"}

My past 2 visits are based on the happy hour menu which is weekdays 3-6 and 9-close. If you are craving this place and are on a budget, by all means come during happy hour! Drink and food specials, which are unbeatable and definitely won't bust your wallet. I've been twice and will probably be back for more just to finish trying all the items on the food part of the menu. Here's the run down of what I've tried.\n\nBuffalo chicken tenders- comes with 2 large pieces and those infamous brenner waffle fries dusted with cocoa powder. You definitely get your money's worth with this because it's a good amount of food for a single person. Spiciness was just right for me and I prefer most of my buffalo style food on the mild side. Perfect amount of sauce because sometimes when you order tenders buffalo style its like dripping with sauce and thankfully that's not the case here. Breading was good and not too thick. Highly recommend!\n\nThe Mini Philly- the perfect combination of cheese and beef. It's practically a match made in heaven. I think it's the 5 cheese blend that does the trick.\n\nBuffalo chicken slider- pretty good too, but I'm not a big fan of feta cheese. Although I would recommend the mini philly rather than this.\n\nOnion rings- pretty standard onion rings. Comes with a chocolate ranch sauce, but it honestly tasted really close to plain ranch with a hint of brown color. \n\nchocolate pizza- loved every bite of it, just like I expected. Half a pizza is big portion for 1 person so you should really plan on sharing this. The combination of the chocolate marshmallow and crust does the trick- Brenner you a pure genius or chocolate genius that is, hahaha.

This review is based on our entire experience.\n\nFirst of all, Uptown Alley does not really give you any breaks for a group event--not even if you are 501(c)(3) or raising funds for a good cause which they knew was our purpose. They charged us $2 each for shoes and  $15/hr per lane (we had 20 lanes reserved). So essentially, we would have to raise at least $1000 just to break even. We were told they would open up early for us at 8AM but we had to be out by 10AM when they opened. Come to find out they already open at 8AM on Saturdays so they weren't doing us any big favors. They wouldn't help us advertise our event in their facility even though it would have helped draw people to their business. They offered us no freebies to our participants to encourage them to come back. Our group has over 2000 members in the local community that we could market Uptown Alley to and support as a local business but nope...they weren't interested in that at all. We weren't allowed to bring in donuts, juice, coffee or any food related items for our participants even though it was supposedly before they opened for business. We had to order from their restaurant with the sampling of breakfasty type items they had. Essentially, we were made to feel like they were REALLY going out of their way and doing us a favor by even allowing us to have our event there at all. If we weren't so set on trying to support a local business, we really would have gone somewhere else but our group really does make an effort to keep it local whenever possible. \n\nThe day of our event went off without a hitch. The staff was polite, courteous, helpful, kind and considerate. This definitely made up for the way we were treated in arranging this event. The bowling was fun with plenty of space, broad shoe selection, decent food, and drinks. The service was a bit slow considering they knew we had a group coming. There was 1 server for all of us and we were the only people in the place...which did open at 8AM per the sign on the door and their website! And he didn't really come back to check on us so my lane's guests only had 1 drink and that was it. The food was alright though and was definitely not what you would expect from bowling alley cuisine. Our group had fun though...but I think it's because it was a fun activity. I mean who doesn't enjoy BOWLING?\n\nAs I've understood it in my efforts to market this event, Uptown Alley isn't very community friendly at all. Our district's special education classes don't even go here because they won't give them a break on price! They go to Peoria to AMF! I'm sorry but if you can't support Special Olympics or SPED and give those kids a break, that's just not saying much about your business's philosophy.\n\nSo, although I'd like to say I'd go back to Uptown Alley because they are a local business and its important to support local businesses, it  might be solely as an independent person but not as part of my 501(c)(3) group.  I'm inclined to pass on group efforts since I believe that local businesses should also be supportive of the community. It's got to be a give-and-take relationship.", "type": "review", "business_id": "XGUrSgfo-ZN9Ib1pIPU-SQ"}

We played on the slot machines right in front until the buzzer went off only 2 minutes later. \nOur hostess was so friendly and we got a full conversation in by the time we were seated. That never happens! She was also able to give us a gluten free menu for one of the members of the group. We were promptly given warm french bread in a cute baguette holder and the server gave the friend gluten free bread without even asking! That is a perfect way to get customers to return! \n\nFor an appetizer we got the baked goat cheese with tomato sauce and garlic bread. We should have ordered these individually because it was heaven on a plate. Everything about this dish had me wanting more.\nFor steak frites (what else would you order), I got the Bordelaise with wine sauce and onions cooked medium-rare. This was a large, tender piece of meat with a pile of fries and plenty of caramelized onions. They really get their portions right! My friends got the Bernaise steak frites and that sauce was pretty spectacular as well. \nFor dessert, we got the profiteroles and I am convinced they imported them straight from France. Again, amazing. I highly recommend! Only weird thing about the meal was that they did nothing for the friends birthday, so I am assuming there was a lack of communication between the hostess and the server.\n\nTotal was around $60 a person for steak, appetizer, dessert, and split bottle of wine.

Back in the day, talking with your senator was always accompanied with free food! (Source: BBQ: The History of an American Institution, Robert F. Moss)\n\n_____________________________________________________________\n\nThe Story:\n\nI consider myself a BBQ aficionado. I've feasted at several of America's most cherished BBQ Pits from coast to coast and roast to roast. Congress has passed legislation that requires BBQ festival patrons to address me as 'your majesty.' Cows and pigs are afraid to make eye contact with me!  So believe me when I tell you, I know the difference between a good and bad brisket. \n\nBecause of such, I take it serious when a restaurant claims to have the best BBQ of a particular locale. Unfortunately, more times than not, these claims are a mix of bravado and marketing. Pork on a Fork happens to be an quintessential example of this phenomenon. \n\nI've been to this outer-beltway Deer Valley location twice and both times ultimately led to me feeling like Mick Jagger (cause I can't get not satisfaction). \n\nThe customer service was not just disengaged with the task at hand, but seemed to have no interest in the customer being there at all. I have tried their pork, brisket, and ribs. All three had the same mass-produced bland flavor that was more reminiscent of fast food than it was masterful BBQ. The brisket was the worst offender, possiblely due to the entire top fat cut off before smoking. The end result, regardless of the reason, was a BBQ sandwich that had the same succulence as a bucket of sand. There are bags of charcoal scattered throughout the restaurant, and I'm sure they're actually used, but a disconnect exists somewhere because it's almost impossible to make anything with such promising beginnings this insipid.\n\nPork on a Fork has great reviews overall. I find this mind boggling based on my experience but sometimes that's just how it goes. There's always the possibility they were having a bad day during my visits. Cooking is more of an art than a science.\n\nIf you're looking for some quick and easy BBQ, stop by.

Sorry Food Express you got beaten by equally tasting food, at a much more affordable price.\n\nThe general rule of thumb is, if you see Asian people (especially elders and parents) eating at a Chinese restaurant, its a good sign. If you see Whites, Mexicans, or Blacks eating at, its usually not a good sign. Yes, as racist as it sound there is some truth to it. To our delight,  walking in Sunday night around 9PM, saw around 12 Asian families eating there. This is a damn good enough sign for me, considering its Sunday.\n\nFood:\nThe star of the show is the lobster in ginger and scallions. Lobster had a sweetness to it, which means freshness. The deep fried sea bass was great as well, very flavorful and deep frying it doesn't kill the taste. The fried tofu in seafood sauce was okay, but the tofu wasn't really crispy. Still tasted good, even though I'm not a big fan of tofu. The beef chow fun tasted great, but I think the portion was a little lacking. The sizzling beef and mushroom in the clay pot was average. I tasted worst, but I certainly have tasted better. The pork soup was great. The sesame desert wasn't one of my favorites, but I'm not a big fan of sesame desert to begin with.\n\nService:\nThe service is fairly amazing. We didn't even really have to ask for anything, including forks, boxes, wet towels, or the check. They just gave us about everything we needed. Waiters were smiling and seemed like they really enjoyed their job. Soup and desert as well, but that is to be expected. The only setback was it took about 5 minutes before I got my teapot refilled from the time I put the lid up (used to signal for more tea). But they did refill it with hot tea, which is nice. \n\nPrice:\nWhat really got my 3 other co-workers and myself was the $9 per lb lobster. Thats at market value, which is awesome. The beef chow fun is about $2 less than Food Express. Everything else on the menu is about the same price as other Chinese restaurant in Vegas.\n\nThis is everything that Food Express offers, except cheaper and better and it doesn't have a stupid name. Service is top notch. Not everything totally impressed me, but nothing disappointed me. This is definitely a place to come back to. 4.5 stars for the great food, price, and service. Needs a little more before I give it a 5 star (I'm hard to impress).", "type": "review", "business_id": "NdQMBelvH0TTe1pIrnFYmA"}

I think it was my favorite pretzel I have ever had. And I get pretzels and cheese everywhere cause I love them. I ordered the trout with green beans. The green beans were great the fish was OK.

I liked it better then the fish for sure but it was equally as good to what my brother got. He ordered the pasta with short ribs in a tomato cream sauce. Meat was a little fatty but omg it was tender. The only thing bad about this is there were beans in it that were over cooked so it made the dish a little grainy. But overall the dish tasted great.

Its weird cause they have a lot of TVs there so I'm not sure if they are trying to be a sports bar or what. Either way it was good!", "type": "review", "business_id": "xY1sPHTA2RGVFlh5tZhs9g"}

So, in a show of support, wearing custom T-shirts that proudly proclaimed \"Team Guza\" we descended on the poor, unsuspecting Native.\n\nNormally, Native is a place I can take or leave....but I have to say this one really did a great job.  They were busy and crowded, KUPD and the Bud Light girls were running around, there were people everywhere, yet our server managed to keep up despite being clearly understaffed.\n\nI ordered a burger and fries, and of course it came while the wing eating was happening.  Now, maybe it was flavored by hunger and the thrill of watching grown men stuff pounds of wings into their gullet, but even cold, that was one terrific burger.  Even the rapidly cooling fries were awesome.\n\nSad to say, the food was the highlight, as my boss was soundly beaten, coming in 7th out of 9 - he did manage to eat 1 lb 7oz of wings, which makes me just a little queasy.  \n\nThis was the best experience I've ever had at a Native,and would be willing to come back to this one again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "FFdlPSZCGgTdg1CAfrlvlw"}

We split the garden salad, a 12oz filet mignon, garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus. I am not a huge red meat eater but OMG was the steak fantastic! We got it med rare (recommended)- This price is PRICY, so split! There is PLENTY of food!!! We enjoyed the meal so much, we ended up staying in the Mirage that night! wink wink\nWe went on a Sunday night, and there was a photographer going around taking pix. Be aware though- she is expensive too!\nThe waterfall the restaurant boasts about is tucked in the far back corner- cant see it, which was a bummer, but overall staff and food were totally worth the price! With sharing and the cheapest bottle of red wine, we still spent $140!\n*Valet the car! The restaurant is right in the front!

You have to look at the take out menu.\n-\"We'll be right with you,\" means 10-15 minutes.\n-\"Let me clean your table first,\" means wipe it down, but then leave the spray bottle on the table.\n-\"We're out of salad,\" supposedly meant \"We're out of salmon,\" which actually means that they had both in stock.  Huh?  I don't know either.\n-The \"office\" for the restaurant is the last table in the corner, with a computer and everything set up in plain view of the customers.\n-Behind the \"office\" is the daycare for the employee's daughters, who had toys, papers and a TV there on the floor.\n-The employee's daughters are nice enough to come and play with their toys on your table.  The toys that have been on the floor and the girl's mouth.  Also, be on the lookout for them throwing their toys around the restaurant.\n-The men's restroom had dirty aprons from the kitchen and an open toolbox.\n-The employee's daughters were also in the men's restroom.  Quite the surprise when I go in and almost trip over a couple little girls.\n-The food is around $10 per dish and is not that good.  But it will take 20-25 minutes to prepare.\n-The macaroni salad is actually a penne salad.  As in, it was penne pasta used in the recipe.  It lacked flavor and was warm.\n-Chicken katsu was mostly breading, very little chicken.  Katsu sauce was barely present on the chicken.\n\nIt was an uncomfortable meal, spending an hour and a half at this restaurant.  A lot of time was spent waiting, but when the food arrived, you spent your time eating while also hoping the kids wouldn't come to your table after playing on the floor the whole time.  Take out is offered, so you can avoid the environment if you go that route.  However, the food was nothing special, so I can't even recommend that.

I was not disappointed!\n\nJust some minor work...oil change, tire rotation, check the brakes, and a quirky instrument panel issue (that I already knew about).  Less than 2 hours after drop-off she called back and confirmed I needed brake work.  She asked if I'd felt a lot of vibration during braking recently (yep), and confirmed her suspicion that the rotors were warped.  Even with replacing the rotors & front brakes, then only adjusting the back brakes (plus oil change & tires), I couldn't believe I was getting out of there for less moolah than I anticipated.  She also gave me pointers on how to drive the vehicle on new brakes, and that they might squeal, but she put a ceramic liner on the pad to reduce the chance of that.  NOWHERE have I ever been before (repair shops or even dealership service departments) where someone told me how to drive on new brakes.\n\nAlthough I opted out today to get the instrument panel fixed, Rosa was kind enough to suggest options for me to find the needed part cheaper if I wanted to, and then she'd install it for me.  How many mechanics suggest alternatives?  Nope, didn't think so. When it comes time for me to get this fixed, I will definitely let Rosa do the work again.\n\nI knew I had struck gold when I went to shake her hand in thanks today, and it was dirty/black from the work she just did on my vehicle.  :)\n\nWorth the drive from Uptown (and the impending light rail trips) to let Rosa service my vehicle.

Urban Outfitters is easily accessible from the Mandalay Place valet and is a good place to quickly pick up a gag gift for an acquaintance or a friend.

My only complaint is that the ticket booths for events don't sell all the tickets to all the shows and seem to close at odd hours.

The chili con queso is delightful too. \n\nDisclaimer:\nThis only works if you have a propensity to see double when drunk.", "type": "review", "business_id": "CEswyP-9SsXRNLR9fFGKKw"}

The dining room area is nicely maintained with enough space between tables to be intimate without being too intimate.  We sat outside and the view of the lake is great.  The patio area is covered in a fancy banquet style tent material that is functional but not tacky or cheap looking.  The only potentially confusing thing about this place is that the front is a wine store, with a wine tasting bar and doesn't automatically register as a hostess stand where one would go to seek seating.\n\nThe service was excellent.  We had read from previous reviews about an infamous Tracy, but both spoke with her on the telephone prior to coming and were promptly seated by her.  Our server was excellent and attentive.\n\nI had the Eggs Bennedict with blue crab.  It was appropriately apportioned, tasty and served with option for caesar salad.  My wife had the lobster croissant.  The lobster croissant was an excellent blend of lobster meat in a light sauce with tomato and avocado.  The frites were thin, delicious and made a good accompaniment to the lobster croissant.\n\nI would recommend dining here.

I absolutely love the theater and have taken advantage of any broadway or musical that came through town, but it wasn't enough. The stages in hotels weren't appropriate, it affected productions, and it was just sad. Anyway, I'm just ecstatic that we have this wonderful institution in our city. The building is absolutely gorgeous with amazing attention-to-detail (even the up and down arrows above the elevator doors are silhouettes of the Carillon Bell Tower, adorable). Plus, the shows to have graced the stage so far have been so amazing with exciting ones to come!\n\nBuying tickets are simple with multiple options for printing. There was one occasion that I had chosen to print my tickets at home, however, I had forgotten them on the day of the show. The individual in the information office was very kind over the phone informing me that they would gladly print the tickets for me at the box office! It was such a relief and really wonderful service. For the 2013-2014 Broadway Las Vegas Series, my fianc\u00e9 and I opted to become season subscribers. The process was simple, however, it just required patience since we had to wait until all of the previous season subscribers had their pickings. For the amount of shows in the series, it is a wonderful deal for the overall price, so if there are several shows you want to see in the upcoming season, it is worthwhile. They're also flexible if you need to change a date in the middle of the season for particular shows.\n\nReynolds Hall is the most popular venue for shows and it is beautifully designed. There really isn't a \"bad\" seat. I've experienced Orchestra, Dress Circle, and Balcony. I really enjoy Dress Circle Center (Row A, of course) because of how you view the stage (I don't like being level with the stage or too close because I feel you miss the big picture). I'm sure with this same idea, I would also enjoy the Box Tier level, however, we have been in Dress Circle Boxes and the chairs aren't as comfortable as the theater seats. The Balcony level is really far away and you will have difficulty seeing if you're near-sighted or can't see as well with long distances (like me). I would recommend binoculars! Also, the first row can be obstructed with the railing depending on your height, so ask an usher for a seat cushion to elevate your height if this is the case!\n\nParking has changed three times since my first visit during their inaugural season. During my last visit on 08/11/2013, you are now directed around the Children's Museum and onto Symphony Park Avenue (between the park and the center) where you can valet or proceed further to self-parking on the left, now parallel to the train tracks. Valet parking has increased to $10. It seems steep compared to what we are accustomed to in Las Vegas, but the Valet team is not joking around. There were approximately 6-7 individuals working at the end of the evening and were literally sprinting to the lot to retrieve cars! Great service.\n\nAs with most concessions, the prices are grossly increased. We're talking regular packs of candies (M&M's, etc) for $3-4, yikes, and there are only 4-5 choices. Definitely skip the snacks. They service top-shelf alcohol ($8 for a single) and they're not watered down! If you want to take your beverages into the theater, you need to purchase a Theater Cup ($3), but the good news is that they are refillable (yay for being green!), so don't forget to bring them back. There's one bartender that likes to ask you if you want a double instead of a single while he's holding the bottle ready, don't do it haha!", "type": "review", "business_id": "BUnnBAtGkX05VJ6xI3y6JA"}

We were told that the room that they held for us were given to people that stayed longer and that our rooms were not guaranteed, even though we booked them about a year in advance.  That makes no sense whatsoever.  We told her we were part of a wedding party that had blocked a bunch of rooms, but they still didn't care.  When they said they had 2 rooms available, the rooms were in 2 separate buildings away from where the bride had wanted us to stay.  We told the lady where we wanted to stay and she said come back in a hour and they should be ready.\n\nWe came back exactly an hour later, only to be told they weren't ready yet.  The lady had us sit and wait 20 more minutes while she waited on a call back to make sure the rooms were clean.  They also had one room with a King bed and one room with 2 doubles, even though my friend and I had both booked rooms with King beds.  I let her have the King room, but once again, what's the point of reserving a room, if you aren't going to get what you asked for.\n\nMy room was okay.  I didn't have problems like my friend had with the sink and safe.  I did not like that you could hear people above you walking or running.  That was really loud.  Also, even though there are shades to keep the light out, it was still bright once the sun started to rise and that made me wake up way earlier than I wanted to.\n\nAfter the first day, my room was not cleaned by 3:00 p.m.  When I was getting ready to meet my friends, the cleaning lady came back around 3:30 p.m. and I told her I will be leaving soon and to come back.  On the day I was leaving, she knocked on my door at 9:00 a.m. to see when she could clean my room and I told her I was leaving today.  Shouldn't she know that?\n\nThe food at the Mexican restaurant and Marilyn's Cafe was just so-so.  We only ate there b/c there was noting else, but it wasn't that great.  I would have gone somewhere else, if there was something else close by.\n\nThe bar in the lobby would have been okay if it wasn't for the jazz music.  I'm not a fan of jazz and did not want to hear it.  Also, the prices for drinks in that bar are ridiculous!!!  My friend and I ordered Shirley Temple's, which consist of Sprite and cherry flavor and they cost $4 each!!!!!!!!  What the heck!?  Also, a small bottle of water, about half the size of a regular bottle, was $4!!!  That is so ridiculous!\n\nThe pool was probably the only thing that wasn't that bad.  We were able to get lounge chairs both times we went to the pool.  I know people I was with were annoyed with the one waitress that was going around getting drink and food orders.  She was taking forever on some things and even gave food to the wrong people.  \n\nOn my last day, I had checked out and wanted to spend a few hours at the pool.  I went into the bathroom to change and I came out and put my stuff on the counter.  The cleaning lady was in there staring at me with an annoyed look, so I asked her if I was in her way.  She rudely said yes and I asked her if I should move to one side or something and she huffed out saying, something about coming back.  So uncalled for!!\n\nWhen it was time to leave, we asked the bellman to get us a cab and he waited about 10-15 mins until he called for one, which of course made us late to get to the airport.\n\nI definitely won't be staying at this hotel again.  I appreciate that my friend picked a  place to help all the wedding guests save money, but it was an awful experience.", "type": "review", "business_id": "3rwM9fPYPk9qDkEBOhyHbg"}

Upon talking to their GM we learned that all their pasta is made fresh in house and a lot of their ingredients are imported directly from Italy.  In our short talk you could tell that there is a lot of thought going into how everything is organized, prepared and made and they care about customers' feedback.  \n\nI couldn't believe how quiet it was for a happy hour though and it made me think about how many people probably don't even know it is there.

That's a miracle to me.\n\nRegarding their products, in general, I'm not a fan: everything feels a little too-goopy and greasy for hair like mine that is already thick and prone to get oily, and the smells are pretty bad (I'm a sucker for Herbal Essences and good old Head & Shoulders scent).  However, when you do the keratin treatments,  your options are rather limited, and I have found a product of theirs that I can use pretty regularly without issue (it's the Fade DePhy color-saving shampoo, which I rotate with Tresseme, a pleasant-smelling shampoo does not over-oil my hair... gosh hair is so high-maintenance).  I feel like my hair is kind of sticky each time I leave the salon.  But, my mum goes to Ann as well, and she has a ton of fragrance allergies, so if you ask, the stylists will accommodate you!\n\nAll in all though, I love this location and will keep coming back.  Ann is a great stylist, and I also adore the girl at the front desk with the red hair (sorry I forget your name!).  But I feel like Mr. Pelusi overshadows the talents and personalities of his stylists with the product placement, which is a shame, as the staff deserves to be in the spotlight instead.\n\nNotes: hair service costs vary by stylist.  Also, they accept credit cards, but if you tip on the credit card instead of in cash, it gets divided amongst the staff, and does not go to your individual stylist.", "type": "review", "business_id": "9u4SqxRrVxE_yfzK6LBJkw"}

This is rococo to the hilt.  The hotel is impressive but the floral smell assaults you as soon as you enter.  As someone with a very sensitive nose (I have sinusitis), I could barely breathe.\nWe got a great great deal on our room (bella suite for $199/nt incl taxes).  However, while waiting in line to check in we decided to ask if they had the rialto available or even concierge level suites.  Well that was like opening pandora's box.  The check in clerk was very friendly but went to great lengths to point out that the Palazzo had the same size suite available at the concierge level for $100 extra.  When asked what this would give us - breakfast, snacks in the afternoons, hors d'oevres in the evening, dessert at night, discounts to the casinos and restaurants, and free access to the health club.  Well, turns out that with our existing deal we were getting all that but the food.    So glad that we didn't fall for the song and dance since the food court is so accessible.\nAnyway, the room was gorgeous.  we LOVED it.  housekeeping was awesome. The pools were so much fun; our kids said that it was just like going to Hawaii only better.  Bouchon is a dream restaurant. The food was so good, I almost cried.  Also went to B&B, Mario Batalli's restaurant.

Before coming here, I've never had enjoyable olives...just not my thing I guess, but I enjoyed most of these very much!  Yum :D\n\nFirst course, Cantaloupe Soup: Almonds and Minted Creme Fraiche. I like cantaloupe, but not really in soup form. Not overly sweet though, just not for me.\n\nSecond course, Grilled Skirt Steak: Italian Sausage Mashed Potatoes, Roasted Brussels Sprouts, and Pinot Noir Reduction with Watercress. This was good, but not a very tender cut in the first place. I really enjoyed the mashed potatoes with the sausage inside though! \n\nAnd for me, Olives Burger ($21): Truffle Cheese, Caramelized Red Onions, and Truffle Fries (+$3). First burger came out MW, sent it back and got a perfect MR. Initial juices pour out front/back, truffle cheese has a tasty bite, and the caramelized onions added a nice crunch! The truffle fries were very good, with lots of truffle oil.  One of the better burgers you will find in Vegas!\n\nAnd to finish, Coconut Caramel Cake: Chocolate Malt Ice Cream and Coconut Brittle. Yummy! Imagine a coconut macaroon cake with a rich chocolate ice cream on top.  MmmmMmm good :)\n\nWe sat outside to enjoy the view and Bellagio fountains, but the fountains weren't working that day! Would have been a great view of them at the patio tables. Loved all the little birds flying around, looking for snacks.  They weren't pestering though, and added a nice touch to the beautiful day.\n\nService was a little off...soup got served without a spoon.

The bank I was using switched from MasterCard to Visa, and I didn't think I would have a problem checking into the hotel because the entire stay was paid for. However I was proved wrong. The clerk said he was going to have to refund the money that I booked the room with (and could take 3-5 days to return to my account), and RECHARGE the full amount for the stay...which of course was a NICE chunk of change. So needless to say I was kinda miffed because this came out of our spending money for the 4 days of our stay. I still don't understand why this had to be done because the full amount was prepaid, and the bank account number/name on card hadn't changed, but what can we do?

What they did instead was make hardy, rib sticking stuff -- and here the 5 & Diner excels. \n\nLast night we had the Meatloaf dinner for $6.99, and Southwest Burger for $9.29.  We washed it down with an Ice Tea for $1.99 and a Malt for $4.99.  This all came to $25.61, before tip.  The service was good and we felt that it offered good value and a nice change of pace.  \n\nYes, the meatloaf was somewhat bland and it was overwhelmed by the brown gravy.  But, it was good.  The burger was tasty with a nice slice of roasted Poblano pepper on top. A nice touch.  It also came with a spicy Mayo dressing that causes the burger to slip off the bun and makes it very hard to eat without a knife and folk.  So here's a good safety tip -- don't sit too close to the table and wear a napkin!  LOL \n\nWill you be confused with 5 & Diner and think that you're eating at Elements? No. Chef Beau MacMillan can rest easy.  But 5 & Diner offers good diner food and is a great place for Shakes or Malts.\n\nEnjoy the 5 & Diner, along with the Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons music!", "type": "review", "business_id": "kOh8ZHf8CkFQCwyfDvVJTA"}

The concert going experience is great. Prices are steeper than other venues in its range but they get great talent so there isnt much you can do about it.

Hipsters like PBR and indie music, all they will get at Sushi Roku is a Sapporo and some fantastic yellowtail. I would call this place \"hip\" though, the decor is very intimate and interesting, especially at night and they do a very good job of being trendy which of course attracts the people that want to be \"seen\". What I mean is Hipster, no. Beautiful people and wanabees, yes. Having said that, I do not think there is a restaurant I have ever seen more actual celebrities at in Scottsdale than this one, recent spottings include Kristen Schaal and Rainn Wilson.  \n\nFor dinner appetizers you can't go wrong with the yellowtail with diced chiles or the hanabi.

The place was pretty dead which was good because I don't like crowds or waiting a long time for my food.\n\nThe decor of the place is pretty much how all the other reviews on here describe it.  It really is a neat little \"sushi cafe\".  I didn't much like the ordering process but I guess that is where the \"cafe\" part comes in.  You aren't seated, given a menu, then free to check little boxes on a piece of paper to let them know what sushi you want.  Instead, you walk up to the counter, look at a menu, and give your order right there.  I felt rushed to give my order as if somebody was behind me waiting to place theirs but there wasn't.  Our cashier/waitress was very nice and patient though.\n\n*Sake Bomber = solid and not bad for $6\n\n*Octopus Salad = gross and I couldn't eat it.  I was expecting something like what they have at RA but it was far from it.  Instead, it was slices of octopus that tasted super fishy and really nasty.\n\n*Edamame = standard\n\n*4 random rolls = pretty good but not outstanding.  We didn't order any crazy rolls though.  I still think Ra/Kona are much better for some reason.  I guess its because I think the fish is fresher at the larger more popular places.  I'm really not the biggest fan of strip-mall sushi places, but the sushi here was ok and not bad at all. \n\nAnyway, I wasn't expecting this place to be as decent as it was.  I'm not sure I am going to rush back though.  However, if I lived across the street I would be there all the time.\n\nWe used a $25 Restaurant.com gift certificate we got for like $5 or something so it wasn't a bad deal.  I would highly recommend giving this place a shot but get one of those certificates first.  Oh, and with the certificate they add an additional 18% gratuity which is a bit weird because you wouldn't think you get service because you order everything at the counter.  You actually DO get service because the cashier/waitress brings you your food, clears your plates, and does the other stuff that standard waitresses do, so they deserve a tip.", "type": "review", "business_id": "rwQIBAM_kHtVl1Ks8Flexw"}

Situated on Decatur and the largest of a handful of locations spanning the city the look and feel of the restaurant can best be summed up as an upscaled Denny's with better coffee alongside a more creative menu and given my early hour of arrival the service was exemplary - an older couple entering just after me the restaurant's only other patrons.  A skeleton crew in the kitchen largely focused on preparing the day's housemade cakes and pastries it was with little delay that decisions were made from the extensive menu and orders placed I chatted with my waitress at length, the longtime veteran of Blueberry Hill keeping coffee filled to the brim and commending my picks while offering suggestions for 'next time' - an occurrence that will be sooner rather than later given the quality of what soon arrived.  Beginning savory and moving to sweet it was with a loaded un-fried Monte Cristo that I began and deferring standard jam with a request for the housemade strawberry compote I'd strongly recommend everyone do the same as the ample sweetness proved a lovely balance to briny ham and smoked turkey...\"balance\" completely ignored by my second selection, the pillow soft pancakes chock-a-block full of crushed cookies and smeared with frosting identical in flavor to the cream-filling, plus whipped cream for garnish.  Sated and heavily caffeinated it was perhaps a bit gluttonous to consider dessert but unable to pass on a rotating cake-case it was with a slice of Red Velvet that I made my departure and waiting until the afternoon to indulge the results were good, if not great, as the cake was moist and rich though I'd have preferred more tang to the icing...a small quibble at $3 for the 11.6oz 'slice.'", "type": "review", "business_id": "SfrHdU4NCkYWvERnWaOUqQ"}

When we go to see the sales guy \"Kendel\" he treats us with a level of contempt because we had questions about rates and wanted to at least tour the gym before signing up.  He eventually let us try out the racquet ball courts, which were the main attraction for us.\n\nDuring our game, Kendal interrupted to let us know of a club special he could offer us after our game. My friend needed a single membership and I was looking into a family membership down the road (month or so), but not today.\n\nThis is what he sold us:\n\"Sign up today and I will wave your initiation fee and give you guest privileges for $25 a month additional.  That way your friend can workout when you come in until his family is ready to start.\"\n\nTwo weeks after this sale Kendal approaches us in the gym and says to me \"how do they keep letting you in here?\" at first I thought he was joking but it turns out he was just being rude.  He then goes on this tear on how we did not sign up or pay for guest privileges.   We argue that we bought the membership suggested by him that included this.  \n\nKendel then calls my friend and me liars and says \"Quit being cheap and just buy a membership.\"   This is all happening at the front desk as we are leaving and a group of employees looks on.\n\nMy friend gets home and pulls up the receipt emailed by Kendel.\nIt shows a first and last month's dues and a $25 \"initiation fee.\"\n\nSo the long and short of this is, Kendel took our money intended for \"guest privileges\" and applied it to the initiation fee which generally goes to the sales person.  I am guessing Kendel did this to close the first sale and then paint me into a corner down the road.\n\nMy honest opinion on the gym is good, but the sales practices of the sales manager KENDAL are predatory to say the least.\n\n[TO FIX THIS: HAVE YOUR BANK DO A \"CHARGEBACK\" TO ANY FEES]", "type": "review", "business_id": "Lui51rpFfyVVOmN8WcB5AQ"}

A medical professional mentioned that it may be my gallbladder and prescribed me three medications that unfortunately didn't help! After having another attack, I took matters into my own hands and decided to research foods that naturally help your gallbladder and most importantly, avoid irritating it.\n\nI found that vegetable juices like beet, cucumber, tender baby greens, swiss chard, dandelion greens, beet greens, celery, carrots, ginger, and tumeric are great for gallbladder health as well as organic grape and apple juices. Other helpful foods to add to juices: lemon, avocado, vinegar, berries, papaya, pears, and flax and hemp seeds/oils.\n\nTherefore, I was on a mission to find organic, cold-pressed juices that utilized these foods and hoped it would heal me! The store is very easy to find, in fact, I had seen it while driving by on Ft. Apache. Access and parking is simple as well. I love the interior! The adorable bee and honeycomb theme complete with adorable packaging, matching wall art, and the amazing table re-purposed from a tree!\n\nThe staff was so friendly, helpful, and insisted on samples. I told him which juices intrigued me and why, so I honed in on Bee WHealthy and Bee On Point. After sampling the two, I chose Bee On Point that is comprised of cucumber, celery, carrot, apple, kale, beet, dandelion, radish, lemon, ginger, turmeric, and pepper (16.9 fl. oz. for $10.99). Neither of the juices really tickled my fancy in the flavor department, however, that truly doesn't bother me nor will it stop me from future consumption because I need to minimize sugar (even natural sugar) intake as much as possible and that's typically what makes juices taste better.\n\nAnyway, the juice was great and filled me for three hours! That was enough time for me to finish what I needed to do for the day and get home for my next meal. The great news is that after just THREE days of eating and drinking the gallbladder-helpful foods, I was able to stop the attacks! It's really wonderful having access to a place like The Juice Standard to have truly healing products when you have health issues. It was honestly the only place I trusted to have something that wouldn't trigger another attack and I was very grateful for it. Your body will heal itself if you give it the right tools. \n\nFYI: You receive $1 off for each glass bottle returned! But the bottles are so nice, you might want to find a purpose for them at home.

Well, I only wish I came @ 3ish since that's when they supposedly serve crab legs, but I did spend a good 2 hours @ The Buffet with the girls!\n\nSo they have a a whole selection of diverse dishes..from soups to pastas to a personalized omelet station. I like to walk around the buffet first to evaluate each and every station. Italian dishes.. check..Asian cuisines..check..Mexican food...check..American..\ncheck..desserts..check. \n\nI would say that it was worth the cost to get in for good quality and unlimited food. I'm always down for anything seafood. So I gorged on the variety of fishes...from calamari to sashimi to sushi to well prepared baked salmon and halibut dishes. These were just some of what I tried and I almost died and went to heaven...hehe..well..let's just say I built up a good enough appetite for all the yumminess to come!\n\nThis buffet is probably one of my favorites in Vegas (Cravings @ The Mirage is awesome too!) and also because I just lovedlovedloved  the interior decor. It had a whimisical feel to it with a good amount of my favorite pastel colors throughout and OMG..LIME GREEN!!! I was in LOVE! Flowers were accentuated throughout the buffet with perfect lighting from the outside. Gosh..I miss it already!\n\nOur group of 9 gals didn't have to wait in line for too long and were seated at a large round table with the bachelorette at the head. Kinda felt like we were in a castle and she was our queen..hehe\n\nAlthough we didn't have our prince charmings at the time, we still felt loved by the awesomeness of good company and delectable, mouth watering dishes.

The decor is modern, beautiful and whimsical. The Food I tried was somewhat Basic and really was OK but was unlike the decor. (maybe I just wanted it to be a little fancier to wow me)  I thought the Kitchen not the servers seemed a bit out of sync to me on our visit here so  that helped influenced me to go with three stars. \n\nThis is a special destination place and is good for groups but  if you desire a private room for your group they must spend at least two thousand dollars. You also need to be aware That a three course dinner with a group of people takes about three hours.\n\nI will say I don't agree with most of the reviewers saying the pricing is too high for what they got. I don't recall all the pricing but from what I remember  $24. for Jidori Chicken, $39. for Kolbe style hanger steak, $30 for Sea bass and $8 for ample sides are really what most places would charge.\n\nI will say I didn't care about the parking because it was 118 degrees, I was all dressed up and didn't feel like walking threw the hot parking lot and we felt like valeting it but the valet was closed to people not staying over night in the casino. \n\nWhile waiting for the group I was joining I decided to try a Negroni ($15.) Cocktail. It was made with all name brand stuff and was a double size. So I think it was a very fair price for a special old school cocktail that is one of Anthony Bourdain's last meal list. It's a very unique taste of bitter, sweet  but not too sweet and boldly strong in a good way and seemed kind of refreshing. They had live entertainment in the lounge and some people were dancing.\n\n\nIt was very dark in the restaurant and so you had to use your phone as a light to read the menu. Our group takes a very long time to decide so I do an Anthony Bourdain and decide to have another cocktail. I don't know how long it took but we arrived at 7 and I looked at my phone and saw it was 8:38 and we still didn't have appetizers yet. I was thinking that they'd come out with dinner but they didn't (Phew) and did arrive after some amount of time. \n\nWhen my halibut arrived I found out it was dry and over cooked but the majority of meals that were served to our table were fine. The waiter asks me how it was and I was honest and said the halibut was very dry and over cooked but still edible and I didn't feel like sending it back. The waiter talked me out of feeling that way and said he'd have a new one for me shortly....and he DID! The new one was cooked just right so it was good. Nothing wrong with it just good sitting on some dried chili pineapple sauce. I did find out latter that the other person at my table with halibut also had dry halibut but didn't tell the waiter. \n\nOver all I was happy and now know I also like Negroni Cocktails. Those cocktails are almost even healthy as the bitters in the drink are good for your liver and help contradict the gin.  The halibut was good but wasn't up there with a few others I had this year so that's why it's three star to me. I know everyone was happy and we would go back again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "6qCDfZ0VAX9-O6X5ZFpXrQ"}

They slice it for free, but I kept it whole so we could rip it.  I ended up eating a few slices of tongue on the drive home, then made a small sandwich for a pre-dinner snack, and then had another one for breakfast the next day.  It tastes like childhood!  I look forward to going back for more meat or a meal soon!", "type": "review", "business_id": "NfdZgoNTGsfth9MS8Qaurg"}

I visited this place after hiking Camelback one morning, and it was just what I needed. \n\nIt's a relatively busy place, especially on a weekend morning, so even though it's been around for a while, I hadn't decided to check it out until recently. And I'm glad I did. Definitely expect to wait, but if you've got good company, you can hang out in their waiting area - the coffee bar - and get yourself some drinks to start with and just chit chat.\n\nThe atmosphere is lively but relaxing; easy to zone out and be in your own little universe. My friend and I ordered two different dishes we were interested in trying and split them - a challah french toast dish and an eggs benedict dish. Both were amazing! We were not disappointed. Though probably not my most favorite french toast in all my life time (I love challah french toast, only way to go), it was quite memorable and something that would encourage me to return so that I can try some of their other items; though knowing me I always seem to go back to what is tried and true.\n\nGive this place a try, you won't be disappointed.

Compared to other places around Tempe and the area like Delish or Greens where main items are between $6-$9, 24 Carrots is charging $11+ for the same items also their juice prices are way to high for the amount!  I went ahead and ordered a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for my kids.  They charged me $5.00 for 1/2 of a sandwich and a few pieces of fruit. It was truly pathetic that they think they can get away with charging that kind of money for literally 1 single piece of bread with about 1 teaspoon of jelly and peanut butter on it that cost them about 20 cents to make.  I don't mind paying for my kids food if they actually get food but if I have to spend $10.00 for 1 full PB&J sandwich then I have to express my concern.  My beet burger was good....not $11 dollars good, unless they lower their prices then I fear they will not be around for a very long time. I went recently to Daily Dose and spent the same amount on a HUGE vegetarian burger and order of kids cheesy pasta for my two small kids to share...we both had leftovers, but not at 24 Carrots we all left hungry.

We wanted to just stay on the resort our first night and wanted a low key and less expensive casual dinner.  Dining at this restaurant was fairly low key, not loud and crazy and if you like people watiching you can sit in their terrace seating which is out on the Mandalay Bay thoroughfare.  Here are my thoughts:\n\nAtmosphere - B\nNot swank but better than most chain restaurants.  Fairly intimate seating allowed us to focus on ourselves and not all of the patrons.\n\nService - C\nThe server was attentive enough but honestly was acting in his attitude and demeanor that being there was the last place on earth he wanted to be.  No smile, no personality, but he was on top of things however he probably could have chilled out on the upselling a bit.\n\nFood - C\nWe each had burgers, I had the swiss & onion (swiss cheese/grilled onions) and wifey had the shrooms & blue (mushrooms/bleu cheese)...I will say this the burgers were better than most burgers you would get at a chain restaurant, they claim that they use grain fed, no hormone, angus beef and I believe them.  The meat was tasty.  Burger came with fries that were very ordinary and probably a little stale, that was dissapointing. Overall slightly less than what I would expect for a $17 burger even if in Vegas.\n\nFor desert we got the krispy kreme doughnut sundae and it was the low light of the meal, I do not recommend it.  A super stale krispy kreme doughnut smothered in cheap soft serve with gobs of whip cream and some tasteless sprinkes.  Cheap at $6 but not worth it.\n\nDrinks were $3.50 for soda which is still a tad pricey flat soda.\n\nI would only eat here again if it were comped or if I was in a hurry because they did get us in and out of there in less than an hour.", "type": "review", "business_id": "zObyDUjiXSTCXa5t6w9ghg"}

Per the other reviews, I thought it might be busy on a Friday night so I called two days in advance to make dinner reservations for 4 at 7:30. \n\nOur party of four arrived at 7:28pm and checked in with the hostess. I was initially relieved that I made the reservations because the place was packed! The hostess said they would come find us when our table was ready so we took a spot standing near the cute merchandise they have for sale and expected maybe a 10-15 minute wait. Luckily our conversation entertained us because before we knew it, 20 minutes had gone by and we were still waiting. We waited another 10 minutes before checking on our table since they were busy but when we did, we were informed that our table would be ready shortly since 5 tables were nearly done. Fine. As we continued to wait, we were approached by a very intoxicated woman and had to endure a very awkward conversation with her. Clearly not the restaurant's fault but maybe someone should have cut this lady off before we had to hear about how her father made french toast?! We finally finished our 50 minute wait and were taken to the bar side of the restaurant where we were placed one table away from the entertainment that evening. It was a middle-aged piano player who talked more than sang and was having a full on conversation with the table next to us. Had we not been waiting for 50 minutes already and didn't have a movie to make in an hour and 15 minutes, I would have demanded a different table.  At this point, I was hoping the service and food were going to make up for this rocky start. Unfortunately, it didn't get much better. \n\nOur waitress showed up after a several minute wait and took our drink order. She was clearly busy but definitely not overly friendly or accommodating. I cautioned my dinner guests that we would need to order ASAP if we ever wanted a chance to make our 9:30 movie and we all picked out our dishes and ordered the next time she came back to our table. Once we ordered and our drinks arrived, we were served garlic bread and I must admit, that was some of the worst garlic bread I've ever had. There was absolutely nothing special about it and it was like someone took out the fluffy, good part of the bread and seasoned the crust. Blah. \n\nBy the time our food arrived close to 30 minutes later, it was clear we had no chance of making our movie. The food was okay but I don't think even the best Italian food at this point would make me want to come back here. The piano guy finally took a break and we were able to have a nice conversation without yelling over him and just decided to enjoy our dinner guests rather than rushing. We didn't end up leaving until most of the place was cleared out (about 10pm) and don't recall ever being offer additional drinks while we chatted.  I do know my water glass was full all the time. At least they got that right. On the way out, we were thanked by 4 different people sitting at the bar as we left. Really? Where has the great service been all night? Apparently sitting at the bar. We will never be back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "MPyxaNVuWlAQqJ0iKV5rQw"}

Great build out, very quaint and rustic with exposed brick and dark wood furniture. Definitely a great \"date\" restaurant (unfortunately, I was with my co-worker so their was no cuddling up over a bottle of Pinot). \n\nOur server, Jodi was super friendly and outgoing. She was actually getting ready to leave Pittsburgh for Boulder, Colorado; likely a big loss for the restaurant because she made us feel at home and she did a great job of walking us through the menu. \n\nThe owner and executive chef, Jason Capps was actually working on some new menu items and he was kind enough to let us test an appetizer and a side dish. He was really personable and you could tell he was passionate about his restaurant and food. He checked in with us throughout the meal and we shared stories about some of the restaurants we tried in Pittsburgh as well as our favorite places to eat in Los Angeles. He has just visited LA so we had plenty to talk about. Apparently Bella Sera is a fairly new restuarant and a compliment to his already successful catering company. All I can say is that Jason is great guy, chef and I am confident that his restaurant will be as successful as his catering  business. \n\nHe made us some amazing veal / sausage meatballs -- definitely amazing. The taste and texture was spot on the gravy was top notch as well. He also made us some brussel sprouts and panchetta ham; blanched and cooked in oil; let me say WOW. Generally speaking, I loathe brussel sprouts but these were delicious. They were not at all bitter and melted in your mouth. I'll never complain about panchetta being incorporated into any meal; fantastic!\n\nI was nursing a pretty rough hangover and felt the need for something heavy and comforting so I ordered the chicken carbonara and was blown away. It was everything I hope for; succulent and creamy but not overwhelmingly rich. The portion was perfect too -- just enough to feel satisfied but not enough for an immediate \"carb nap.\" \n\nMy colleague ordered the special; half a baked chicken on the bone with a mustard rub, garlic roasted potatoes and mixed vegetables. He ranted and raved about how much it loved it. I tried a piece of his chicken and the rub was to die for. \n\nIn the end, I felt vindicated after having a string of \"so-so\" meals in Pittsburgh. I would highly, highly recommend that you give this place a try. For me, a big part of dining out is the experience, the ambiance, the service, etc. etc. Obviously, the food is important but it is only one piece of the puzzle for me.

A very traditional dish that most places don't serve.  Normally I order a chimi when trying out a new place, but I made an exception here and ordered the mole.\n\nThe rice was very ordinary.  Not bad, but I can't really say I liked it either.  Plain white rice would have been as good or better.   The chicken mole was very flavorful. It was very intense, and good.  I believe it when they say \"22 herbs and spices\".  I enjoyed it.  The tortillas that accompany the mole started out good (warm, soft), but they cooled pretty quickly and became rather brittle.

Seriously, am I that old?!? I mean, it's a Thursday...and it's a COFFEE SHOP. It's totally cool to have a bar next door, but why must the door remain propped open? I even closed it at one point, and then they opened it back up again. It totally killed the vibe of the room I was in. If I wanted a \"thirsty Thursday\"-style dance party complete with horny and drunk college kids in heels they can't walk in, I would have gone next door. So, now I have to re-think my first impression. I would have given this place five stars if it weren't for that issue. Can someone who works there explain this, please??", "type": "review", "business_id": "p_wNn2SZ8iFtpVbetmUA_w"}

Finally made it to BLB for date night. \n\nIt takes kajungas to plant an upscale French-Mediterranean joint in the middle of a half-vacant Family Dollar shopping center. Maybe they think the food's good enough to pack 'em in, despite the discordant surroundings. Based on the experience we had this evening, they could be right.\n\nI really like this space - high ceilings, wood but not too much, large windows that let the sun and views of the train tracks, pawn shop, et all in (I heart p/m). Cozy area at entry for couch-sitting and drink-sipping. Actual Smorgasbord cabinets lining one wall, ostensibly for Sunday Brunch. Outside patio for us smokers, thanks dudes!\n\nSo we had pretty much everything veg on the menu, since, you know, it was date night and all. There are really only 4-5 things to choose from, and much fewer if you're vegan. The house vinaigrette was really rad - dill/lemon emulsion, super green yet light. Lavash, accompanied by hummus (thickened to the point of becoming paste, but very savory, topped with thyme, yumm) and baba ganoush (a little thin and sweet, I was missing a tahini kick) was dainty, architectural, perfect. Mushroom brioche was intense with truffle oil and seared 'shrooms, but the brioche was less sponge, more stale bread, which didn't kill the plate for me, but took some of the enjoyment out of it. \n\nThere's a roasted veggie sandwich on their menu. Despite my recent ranting about the overused Roasted Red Pepper and its being the go-to for every vegetarian main in our fair city, this was enjoyable - dense, fruity bread, piles of thick, roasted tomato and pepper, some tart goat cheese scattered on top. Had to try the homemade gnocchi - although slightly green, I didn't get spinach, but the texture was amazing - somewhere between ricotta cloud and french fry. Neat.\n\nService was smart, quick, enjoyable, and shared. Between being checked on, chatted with, greeted and bid farewell, I think we talked to at least half of the staff before we were finally done.\n\nAll that for the whopping price of 30 bucks.

It was an easy decision to stiff somebody that spent about 5 seconds at my table, while she was constantly checking on the family next to us that was older and looked like they had money.\nLuckily she saved me $15 and allowed me a little more money to donate at the slots. \nAlso, the man at the macaroni station was kind of a prick, the girl in line before us was asking him questions and he was visibly pissed and didn't say a word to her when she said thank you. Maybe they should try labeling the items at the station? It's a little hard to tell the difference between chopped chicken, bacon, crab, sausage, and ham...\n\nIn short, if you want a Vegas experience that you'll talk about and have cool pictures of when you get home, try the Wicked Spoon, if you just want to go stuff yourself with good food, almost any mid-level property on the strip is a better deal.", "type": "review", "business_id": "zt1TpTuJ6y9n551sw9TaEg"}

Outside the club was complete madness! Groups of people waiting in line and more groups trying to sneak their way in without waiting. \n\nI think we got in around 1AM and the main room was playing some type of techno music. Not my cup of tea. We checked out the pool area and it was really nice. But it was also crowded. If I was rating the day club I'd probably give 4-5 stars especially if you get the separate hot tubs.\n\nThere are three rooms total: Main, BoomBox and Library. We only went to the BoomBox where they were playing Hip Hop music. Now that's the music I can dance to. However I didn't get to dance much because it was SOOO crowded! Not to mention the space is pretty small already. Also to get to this other room we had to climb some stairs. I believe I already mentioned my hatred of stairs in a club before. I swear it could be a disaster waiting to happen.\n\nOverall I still had fun but if I had to go to another club again I prefer XS at Encore.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Ht8mXLuqJSTPrU9kvzosUA"}

What can't be forgiven is the filth.  The dining area is smaller than my living room which means there is no excuse for not keeping it clean.  The ceiling fans were caked with dust and grit as were many of the surfaces.  The floor was filthy.  Come on, guys, that place could be cleaned daily in less than 15 minutes. If the public area is that way, one can imagine what is in the kitchen.  I took my food home, opened the box, was craving Mexican food, but could not get myself to eat any of it, thinking of the general filth of the dining area and its implications for the kitchen.  I like seeing little places like this succeed, so I hope that someone decides to start cleaning this place on a regular basis.

Let me count the ways:\n\n1.  The cozy cottage and gorgeous bar area complete with twinkle lights make me forget I am right off of Mill Ave which is a definite plus.\n\n2.  There are plenty of delicious options at lunch and dinner for my non-meat eating friends.\n\n3.  One of the most underrated wine lists in the Valley at a far lower markup than other restaurants of its caliber in the area.  Example, several years ago before Turley blew up and became a trendy wine, I used to enjoy bottles there for $45!!!  Crazy, I know...\n\n4.  Their food is fresh and divine.  Their dinner menu changes seasonally and their creative chef always offers very inventive specials that you wish would be put permanently on the menu.  Some of my favorites are the Ahi tuna and the oh so tender Petite Filet Mignon.\n\n5.  They recently added a Happy Hour!!!!  (Multiple exclamation points because we all know I like the sauce : )  )\n\n6.  House of Tricks became the first restaurant in all of Arizona that my food snob of a mother insists I take her to every time she comes in town to visit.\n\nI have to take one star away (well, really only a half a star if I had my way) because their lunch prices are a bit steep and it upsets me that my wallet prohibits me from eating there as often as I'd like.\n\nIf you've never been there, run don't walk.

The lobby area features a blown glass chandelier that was created by Washington's own Dale Chihuly.\n\nThe Bellagio shops feature a wide area of fancy stores where piles of money can be spent if that's your thing, or you can just sit back and people watch all day both here and on the casino floor. Speaking of dropping lots of cash and casino floors, the Bellagio combines both of these options in to one handy gaming area as well as a very large sports betting area.\n\nMy favorite feature about this hotel is the buffet restaurant that has a ton of great food at a price that's not too bad considering everything that you get.", "type": "review", "business_id": "-7yF42k0CcJhtPw51oaOqQ"}

Portions were small and the quality of food was not what I would expect from an Iron chef. For example, the carne as ado was minuscule dry and unappetizing. The Benedict was made with brioche, which did not translate well. The mahi mahi tacos were smaller then I would expect from an appetizer but they were served as an entree and the list goes on. The drinks were tasty but served in tiny glasses and way over priced.  Worst of all the service throughout the entire experience at best, very poor.

They did a nice job converting the space that formerly housed South Beach, with a large bar area and nice dining room area. The service, for only being open a short while, was wonderful - we sat in the bar area and had multiple servers checking in on us regularly. They have happy hour in the bar area from 4-7 nightly, and there are even tables and booths, so you might as well sit there if it's during those hours. Happy hour drink prices are good but not a steal - $5 well drinks, margaritas, and wine, $3 bottles of beer. The crabmeat and cabbage \"enchiladas\" (regular menu) were a tasty, light appetizer. For entrees, we had Bob's Big Burger and the chicken flatbread off the happy hour menu. The burger was a bit overcooked but the thin fries were great. They don't discount the burger for happy hour, so you're probably better off getting Roaring Fork's Big-Ass Burger during happy hour. The flatbread was great and a great value - $8 on happy hour for a pretty sizable portion (8 slices). The beet cake dessert with carrot gelato was definitely unique and surprisingly good.

I couldn't help myself, french toast with bacon, strawberries, blueberries, bananas, peanut butter, and nutella, served with maple syrup. COME ON, even if you don't want it, you have to be interested, right? It was a heaping portion, for $13 and I only ate half. The mix of flavors is decent, french toast was done right, fluffy, not mushy, nice char on the bread, but not over-powering. Bread used it perfect, big and much like Texas toast style. Fruits were fresh and helpful since the meal is so very filling. Peanut-butter and Nutella flavors go well with the banana, but not so much the bacon in my opinion. I would opt to have the bacon on the side. \n\nI've also had the Hen House wrap here, and I believe it's better than the Fat Elvis. Wrap was not mushy or dry. Lettuce was crispy and fresh. Chicken was grilled well and honestly, probably one of the better wraps I've had in my existence of eating wraps. And I don't regularly consume them. Coffee is also good and comes in a nice, large cup.\n\nBonus - they have PINK lemonade on their menu. Yes, I ordered it. Yes, it was good. \n\nOverall return factor very likely.

If I could give it 5 stars + I would! It's a really gem tucked away on the busy noisy street of South Clerk Street and you feel like you have stepped inside another world/time and the busy outside is lost!\n\nWith only about 4 tables, offering over 250 varieties of loose tea, this little shop also is an antique shop so it's like sitting in a treasure trove or your grandmother's house, with classical music playing in the background and delicious proper teacups and pots of tea. They also offer scones, chocolates and various tarts (be warned the lemon tart disappears fast!).\n\nOther than this, the owners are the sweetest loveliest people, and strive to make this little place a haven for the end of the week. That's the other thing, this place is only open on Friday to Sunday and if there are more than two I would strongly recommend you book a table at prime tea times(4-7) or late mornings. \n\nAlso, sadly, there is no toilet in here, which can be quite inconvenient for a tea drinker. However, fear not! The pub across the street is used to Anteaques customers bustling in for the loo so that's that sorted.\nBack to Anteaques, if you are stuck on what tea to get take a look at their seasonal selection, or try narrowing down to variety of tea (black, herbal, white or infusion). Personally a standard favourite in Vanilla Chai, however, strawberry, cherry almond, orange pistachio and roibois are also excellent. Tea though is a matter of taste right? The owners of course know a lot about tea, and you are welcome to smell their samples they have in order to help you choose. Another added star goes to the price, only 2.50 for a large pot of tea which holds about 6 cups. You don't get quality tea like that for that price and quantity anywhere else in the city as far as I am aware of. (you would be lucky with a tea bag in a mug!).\n\nSo come to Anteaques for a unique tea experience!", "type": "review", "business_id": "qAkk0DaKLotxX2UzSPg9fQ"}

So it is not cramped or separated you can see everything and everyone within his restaurant and all of his Pittsburgh Steelers stuff. So if you are a Pittsburgh Steelers Fan i recommend this place not only for the food but for you die hard fans that love to be around other die hard fans.  I am personally not a fan of the steelers because I wasn't brought up  a steeler fan but i am  definitely a fan of the Food and how comforting warm and inviting Randy and his staff are.  I have been to plenty of mom and pop type restaurants or shops and I have never felt as welcome as I feel whenever I step foot into Pittsburgh Willy's.  \n\nNow more big Big BIG news! They Serve my favorite meal of the day! BREAKFAST!!\nbut i am extremely picky when it comes to breakfast. I ordered a couple of things and still have yet to try everything else on the breakfast menu.  First I ordered the Big Victor, a green chili pork burrito with scrambled eggs and cheese! So here's the thing when i think of a breakfast burrito i think Big, Flavorful and scrambled and wrapped in a tortilla. Now when i took several bites i noticed that all the eggs were to one side,and the meat on another side. I love eggs and all but i need it to be in moderation to my meats and or veggies.  So when i took a bite of egg id have to take a small bite out of other corners for the cheese and meat. Sounds weird but that's just me i don't want to take a massive bite of the whole burrito stuffed in my mouth that's definitely not classy lady like behavior when you eat in front of people. So next time i order i will see if it can be scrambled to avoid the problem at hand for myself. Just like i did when i had difficulties eating the big willy mac and chili. Order it sloppy every time so its easier to eat. Situation Solved!  There is a habanero sauce that definitely gives it a little more kick with not too much bang as long as you do NOT drench the opening with the sauce.  \n\nFrench toast: definitely bread pudding style thick, crisp on the outsides slightly moist in the middle i am currently letting it drench in butter and syrup as i type this to see what impact that has.  When i make french toast or bread pudding i love letting it soak in the custards over night so its almost like eating something that melts in your mouth within seconds.  So after waiting a couple hours the syrup soaked in a little bit making it a little moister in the middle.  I dont care for hot syrup so i poured more syrup on. There is a flavor within the french toast that makes it different from others that is quite yummy. I was so spoiled with crackers and co french toast with its cinnamon roll type innards that randys french toast was something completely different but still good.\n\nI Still have yet to try the scrambles and the biscuits and gravy fresh and when i do i will edit this review and add it in. :)\n\n\n\nI", "type": "review", "business_id": "IVBp-lRZMliHsS2q0c8ZEA"}

Very rich so the mini size was perfect. I do have to say though after a couple of days (that included driving back from Vegas to LA = direct sun exposure) it tasted the best the day we bought it.\n-Denver mix (small: $6.95): the caramel in this is not my favorite, but I do like the white cheddar flavor - it isn't overwhelming. I wanted to compare this to the Garrett Popcorn mix from Chicago, and Garrett Popcorn wins this round for sure.\n\nHonestly - the 5 stars are for the dill pickle and jalapeno ranch (how many times have I typed out that flavor combination? getting redundant...) Based on the flavors I tried, I think they are on POINT with their savory flavors. The popped kernels aren't as big as Garrett Popcorn, but there is still great texture and I found very few unpopped kernels in the bags.  \nPrices were also very reasonable! the amount you get for the money you pay is honestly a really really good value.

After experiencing a wonderful meal there, complete w/ terrific saffron-rosewater ice cream (with wafer cookies!!), Mom and I wished I'd bought three (the max offered)!  \n\nIt's a a step or two up from being a dive, but I was completely ready to get an earful from Mom-- I DIDN'T, which still surprises me now just thinking about it.  I immediately looked up at the wall menus to see what Mom and I would like , while Mom sat at the table sulkily flipping over the paper menu.  I decided on trying the steak kabob wrap, while I chose the lamb kabob platter for Mom, especially when I saw that it included saffron rice.\n\nAs we sat waiting for our food, we noticed that it was very cold in there due to all of the ceiling fans running on full blast.  I had to retrieve my sweater from the car so that Mom could stop shivering.  I didn't think it was necessary to have all the fans on, but I didn't complain.  \n\nWe were ooh'ing and aah'ing from our first bites!  I haven't seen her so happy w/ a meal out for a long time...  I couldn't try the lamb (allergy), but her plate looked delicious, w/ a huge skewer of tender lamb cutlets, perfectly grilled, a generous serving of saffron-sprinkled basmati rice, a roasted tomato, and onions.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zaytoon-kabob-bistro-phoenix?select=uX1Sejv2TWyKlx_uQqI3QQ#uX1Sejv2TWyKlx_uQqI3QQ  Adding more veggies would've made the platter better, but Mom really was happy w/ her meal.  I loved my steak kabob wrap-- the steak chunks could've been a little less fatty, but they were tender and juicy.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zaytoon-kabob-bistro-phoenix?select=AorqavIoTJg5u_lISQ42hg#AorqavIoTJg5u_lISQ42hg  I wished there were more pieces...  I'd ordered the wrap instead of the platter, bec. I wanted the bread, but I kept wishing there were more veggies in my wrap, so I'll have to try the platter next time and just order a pita on the side.\n\nWhile the entrees were delicious, it was the homemade ice cream that stole the show!  It's listed as \"Saffron ice cream,\" but it also contained rosewater, tiny chunky pieces of almond paste, and pistachios. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zaytoon-kabob-bistro-phoenix?select=ucKC5wE-qiNW6g_Cz1TdJw#ucKC5wE-qiNW6g_Cz1TdJw  It was PERFECT!  I was very tempted to buy a pint to take home, but it's so delicious, I didn't want to binge on the stuff!  It's an excellent ending to a terrific meal.  (We would go back just to have this- it's that good!)\n\nZaytoon was a bit price-y, especially w/ its cafeteria-style atmosphere- Z's certainly not a place you'd like to take a date to!  Spiffy up the place a bit, Z!!  However, we'll be back, w/ or w/o a groupon!\n\np.s.

Their soups used to consistently wow me, but I can't remember the last time I had one that was even passable. Sandwich fixings are being poorly cut so you end up with things like half inch thick cucumber slices and bread of wildly different sizes on either side of the sandwich. Portion sizes are also shrinking to the point of ridiculousness, and the cup of soup for (i believe) $3.50 is becoming increasingly offensive.   Prices overall have gotten pretty nuts.

Some other reviews touch on a few of these things, but I am about to break down the nitty gritty. There is a TON of potential for this place, however, I think they were anxious to make some lost money back so they opened too soon. Read on to find out why. \n\nTHE GOOD:\n\n(Please note some things will be on both the good and bad list)\n\n1. The rides. The few they had were pretty awesome. The yellow tube was super fast and great as a double ride. The mats were a blast trying to race your friends to the bottom. Also the Zuma Zuma (bootleg Bombay for the old schoolers) was a family hit. \n\n2. Some of the food. The pizza combo, a large pizza and pitcher of soda for under $25. You let me know another water or amusement park that feeds a family for that price. TIP: ask them to make the pizza fresh for you! \n\n3. Free tubes! You are not suppose to take em out the water, but many did. If you can grab one, enjoy it, then let someone else enjoy it. \n\n4. NO SMOKING! Yep, that's right, if you want to give yourself cancer, there is a nice place for you to do so, OUTSIDE of the park. \n\n5. Customer service. Other than one little kink with the owner, the staff was great!! The lifeguards were all telling my niece happy birthday and giving her high fives. Everyone seemed to be trying their hardest to please, because there were some things the 16 year old lifeguards, just can't fix!  \n\n6. Wave pool. Super strong tides, and a very short break period between waves. Loved it! Only bad part is, it should go a bit deeper. \n\n7. The layout. Reminds me of old Wet N Wild. \n\nTHE BAD:\n\n1. Consistency!!!! One lifeguard says parents can go down the kid slides with their kids, one lifeguard says no. We tell the owner, he doesn't even apologize about the lack of training, he simply offers refunds. Cool and all, but we were not looking for refunds! \nAgain with the consistency, the weight limits on the rides, make up your mind. The pink slide, you have to be between 130-230 pounds, or you are not going on it. HOWEVER, there is no rule enforcement because my daughter who weighs less, and my boyfriend who weighs more, BOTH RODE THE RIDE FINE!!!\nJust figure it out, these employees have not had enough training! They are trying hard, but people are clearly taking advantage. ALSO, PLEASE POST ALL WEIGHT LIMITS!! THE POSTED SIGN OUT FRONT SAYS 260, BUT ONCE INSIDE, THERE IS A 230 LIMIT, AND A 250 LIMIT. WHEN YOU ONLY HAVE 5 SLIDES, WE NEED TO KNOW THIS!!\n\n2. The other half of the food. The churros were rock hard, even the kids did not like it! LAME. Again, if the employees were trained better, they would know not to serve that. \n\n3. The rides. I think they need more tubes for almost all the rides. The green slide was closed. The weight limits. (they keep changing them) The slides that are NOT being worked on as promised. It should be half price until all rides are open! The few rides that they have are great, so my hopes are high for the rest of them. \n\n4. The staff. Yes the customer service was evident, but where are the adults? I think half of the reason people were simply taking tubes, going on rides regardless of the weight limit, and smoking was due to the lack of security presence.The lack of ADULT presence. They do serve alcohol. What happens when someone gets belligerent? They literally had to track down a 21 year old to poor my wine. Which makes me wonder how many are even on site? \n\n5. WHERE IS THE SHADE?!? The effort was there. You do not NEED a cabana for good seats. But the shade shifts so no matter where you sit, you won't have shade all day. At the top of the rides, those poor lifeguards! You built an entire water park you couldn't have added an umbrella at the top for the staff? Also, when standing in line? People who do not have shoes, totally baking!! Lots of sunburns around the park!\n\n6. NO FAMILY RIDE!! Enough said! \n\nBy April of next year, this place could easily be the best water park in Vegas! Add about 4 more slides, fix the weight issue, add more tubes (free and rides), open that little restaurant in the corner, add some more bathrooms and signs of how to get to them, and entertain a crash course training! \nI also think they should have weekly deals. IE: HALF PRICE WEEK FOR HONOR ROLL STUDENTS. IF YOUR NAME IS RANDY OR BRENDA YOU GET ONE DAY FREE ENTRY. SEASON PASS HOLDERS GET A FREE PIZZA. \n\nA ton of possibilities, I just hope they choose to take advantage of their full potential!", "type": "review", "business_id": "UH4BReVAqpMVjyVroEJAGA"}

They are two different animals. A group of us went here for my GFs 30th bday. To our surprise our waiter Kristoff was from Poland as was the birthday girl and 2 others so this set an excellent tone to our dinner.\n\nStarters: House made bread and butter. This was perhaps the best I have had since I left Europe. I am accustomed to cheap excellent bread and we got as much as we could eat which was nice. Never once was there any attitude from anyone, and you could almost forget you are in a fine dining establishment. The house wines were delicious and quite pleasant on the palate. I also had the French Onion soup which was outstanding. \n\nDinners: I had the Steak Frites. It was stunningly cooked and the fries were the bomb. I tried my GFs duck and it was also outstanding. Everything was cooked beautifully, seasoned perfectly and beautiful to look at. This is how I remember french cooking. No one had anything negative to say which is unusual in a part of 6 demanding foodies. Hats off\n\nDesserts: We had basically one of everything. It was all good but I think the creme brulee and the custard (flan) stood out to me. The bouchons were nice but I am not a huge chocolate freak so others enjoyed things differently. Everything was delicious though so dont think I am not recommending anything. We also ordered some coffees and I liked that the caffe au lait was brought with refills left on the table. \n\n\nOver all I can only tell you that this is one of the best meals I have ever had. Its not cheap, but its also not outrageous. If you are in Napa or Vegas, be sure to visit for dinner. you wont regret it. The brunch while delicious is a distant second to the dinners. If you only pick one, make it dinner.", "type": "review", "business_id": "tFU2Js_nbIZOrnKfYJYBBg"}

The garlic naan was very good but it took a long time for them to bring it to the table (I appreciate that they want to make it fresh but when you're half way through your meal by the time it comes it's a little too slow).  The shocker came with the bill.  $10.99 for the lunch buffet.  Really?  For limited options and not that amazing of food, kind of a disappointment.  There are plenty of really awesome Indian lunch buffets that are $8.99 that I will be going to instead (I know it's only $2 but it just wasn't that great).

We ended up giving one of the child passes to someone in line buying tickets since we only had 1 child.  The festival is quite large with tons of food vendors and a lot of rides.  \n\nThere is one booth there that sells their souvenir cups for $5 and then you can come back for free refills - they have about 4 different flavored lemonades (strawberry, blueberry, regular and mango) out on the table, and you can walk up and refill your cup.  If you need more ice, they'll gladly put more in for you.  The lemonades are a little bland, but for free, it's worth every penny considering the other food vendors charge $2.50 for refills.  \n\nAs the evening wore on, the lines for the adult rides got extremely long that it wasn't worth the wait.  The kiddie rides had about a 5-10 minute wait depending on what ride you wanted to go on.\n\nAs for the ostrich?  I thought this was an ostrich festival - at the VERY far end of the park, there is a fence with TWO ostrich in them.  That's it.  Just 2.  You could see more ostriches if you went to the ostrich race, but you have to get there to get a seat at least 45 min before the race or you won't be able to see a thing.  We later saw that they were selling ostrich burgers...maybe that's why there were only 2 ostrich on display.  \n\nOverall, this was basically a miniature version of the state fair.

The meat has a very sweet flavor, very noticeably sweet. When I asked about it, they told me the meat is marinated in orange juice and does have a sweet flavor.

Despite the fun decor and atmosphere, we would not go back. If you are looking for good, authentic mexican, this is not the place. It's nothing like Carolina's or La Canasta (very good simple authentic mexican food) - they can't even compete with Macayos. The chips were ok, didn't like the salsa though.

First, if you are meeting with clients or going out as a team, it provides a great atmosphere for discussion and sushi is a great communal fare. Second, if you want to grab a swanky drink and eats with a date before a movie or before heading up to \"The Suite\" to dance the night away up stairs. \n\nA couple tips, avoid the surf and turf roll, it sounds good but it's not that great. The Rock shrimp appetizer is great! And I really like to get the Sexy Salmon roll is awesome and the Checkers Roll is good if you like cream cheese in your sushi. Avoid sitting in the weird seats in the bar with no back support unless you plan on being there for less than a half hour, they get uncomfortable quickly.\n\nWhy it's not 5 stars: It's expensive.

One of the worst hotels on the strip - and I mean that because I have stayed at many (from the Tropicana to the Venetian baby). Every time I come to Vegas, which is fairly often, I like to try some place new. I've been wanting to stay at Paris for awhile, but every other time I have come, the rooms have been too bloody expensive. Surely for the price they were charging I was going to have an extra-ordinary experience? WRONG! This time I'm on the company bill, so now the room fits into the per diem. And its not even the room that's the problem, although I'm sure as hell glad that I didn't stay here when it was $200+ a night. I would have felt TOTALLY ripped off. Its everything else about the hotel that blows. NOOOO breakfast options. As another Yelper said, when you're looking for that hangover cure, you sure as hell better look somewhere else other than Paris because there is nothing here other than a Boulangerie with a bunch of crappy pastries. I paid $18.75 for a fruit salad, croissant and coffee. That says something right there. The casino is minuscule and very uninspiring.The slot selection is ridiculous. And lastly, I ordered room service and the pizza I was served had to have been one of the worst I'd ever eaten in my life. The only reason why I continued to eat it is because it cost $17 and who could let that go to waste? I give Paris 2 stars because 1, the rooms aren't terrible and 2, its connected to the monorail which makes it convenient to the Convention Center. Other than that, I'm sure you'd have a better time at Circus Circus rather than here", "type": "review", "business_id": "bYhpy9u8fKkGhYHtvYXazQ"}

Several golfers that I had played with on other courses suggested I try it.  When I arrived, it was evident that there was construction of a new pro shop, and I had to wander around until I found the temporary pro shop in a trailer. Not being deterred by the immediate construction area, I was anticipating the round from everything I had heard about the course.\n\nThe golf course is great.  They have a very nice driving range and practice area, and it is included in the price of the round.  I was favorably impressed, as the range was in great shape, the yardage was provided to the flags, and the hitting area was level. Plus, because it wasn't busy, I could spend as much time on the range as I wanted, before I played.\n\nThe fairways are in excellent condition, and the greens were true.  There are houses along the golf course, but they are set back enough that you do not have to worry about hitting them with errant shots.  Several of the holes are fairly straightforward, but most are outstanding.  Some I consider  the most picturesque in the area, and because of the elevation, many holes have wonderful views of the valley.\n\nApparently they have new owners/management, and they are really working at making the club a first class experience.

Note, you have to spend $30 dollars at dinner to get into the club. Everyone has to order something. That's fine...since it's expensive to get into the club anyways. The bad part starts after dinner - You get a stamp on your wrist to get into the club...or so you think. When you get up the stairs to the \"club\" area, the bouncer tells you that's not the right stamp to get into the club. It's the stamp to get in the \"fasttrack\" line to get into the club. Okay... so after waiting in a short line to go upstairs and find this out from the bouncer, we head outside of the club and realize there is a pretty long line to get back into the club and get the \"correct\" stamp. After waiting about 30 minutes of that, its back to waiting in line on the stairs to get into the actual club area on the second floor. Keep in mind, the other line without dinner or table service DOES NOT MOVE. AT ALL. If you think you can just stroll in at its peak hour, you are SOL.\n\nAnyways, we finally make it to the club area - it should be all gravy right? WRONG. There is not an inch of space to move around in this overrated, overhyped, overCROWDED club! On top of that, the bouncers are telling everyone to move all the time and keep the hallways clear...but there is nowhere to move to! The way it's set up, it's a narrow hallway once you enter with the big bar on the left. You have to turn 3 corners to actually get to the dance floor. We never even made it there because we couldn't get through all the people. The bathroom lines are insane because of the overcrowding. It's impossible to get a drink since you can't tell where the lines start and where people are just standing. It's shoulder to shoulder action up in this joint. \n\nThe funny thing about this whole ordeal is, one of the people in our party didn't have a dress shirt so he had to go back and change while we were going through this process. I guess the dress code is pretty strict. When he finally got back 40 minutes later, we were all just about to get out of there and he was pretty pissed lol. I think Alli G. put it best when she wrote:\n\n\"If you want DANCE and BREATHE and have FUN, go elsewhere. But if you want to be pushed around and smashed between large crowds of people, while staring at some chic in a bathtub, TAO is your place!\n\"\n\nSeriously, if you want to get your dance on, this is not the place.

They only spread low limit games (the highest is an occasional $4/8 game). They have $3/6 limit and $1/2 and $2/5(?) NL. I have only played limit there and it's a pretty soft game. I think the no limit games would be really easy to crack for a solid player. The majority of the players looked like they'd just turned 21 and were playing with their egos instead of their cards.\n\nThe room itself is pretty decent, with about a dozen tables. It's non-smoking and there's are tons of TVs (used to be the sportsbook) They'd recovered the tables since I'd been there last, and I'm not sure who picked the surface material, but they'd obviously never actually tried playing on it. It was like playing on a big blanket. The felt wasn't taught and it felt almost like some sort of microsuede that neither the chips nor the cards slid easily along. A real pain to play on. The dealers were pretty good overall and actually talked to the players. To say that the cocktail waitresses left a little something to be desired would be quite the understatement - by Vegas standards, they were thoroughly unattractive. The bathrooms are right outside the poker room, which isn't something I really appreciated, until I played at the Wynn and had to walk a good ways from the poker room.\n\nAs I said, the game is pretty soft and unless the cards are totally against you, I think it would be hard to have a losing session (assuming correct play).

I had heard pretty good things from friends and fellow Yelpers, but Johnny Smalls fell flat for me.\n\nThe food and service were just blah. I came with a party of seven on a Friday evening and we were all shocked to see how empty the place was. This was already not boding well in my mind. We were seated and I quite enjoyed the seating situation. Comfortable, with plenty of space and lighting to chat amongst the group. It took quite a bit of time before our waiter even approached us. He took our drink order and there was yet another long gap in time until he returned to take our food order. Our drinks took some time to come out and he forgot our requested lemons even after being asked three separate times by us. We finally just gave up.\n\nI started with the pineapple mojito, while my fella got a draft. My friends all ordered cocktails as well. We were pleased with our cocktails and unfortunately, this was probably the highlight of our whole meal. \n\nWith our group as big as it was, we were able to sample just about everything off the menu, or at least a lot of it. Most of the dishes were completely unmemorable, but there were some good, some bad and some ugly of what I tried.\n\nThe Good (no standouts, but just ok to edible menu items):\n\nPineapple Mojito - A little over carbonated, but tasty.\nPhillyish - Best of the sandwiches. Wish it was a little meltier.\nPB&J Sandwiches - Highlight of the meal. Sad, huh?\nChicken LIttle - NIce spicy kick. Too much bun. \nShorty - Tasty, but needed more flavor.\nJack & Coke - Overly sweet and gritty, but ok.\nThe FInger - Perfect chicken finger. Blue Cheese chip had a terrible flavor. Don't try it.\n\nThe Bad (just not good):\n\nBruschetta - Oily and bland.\nMeat Lovers Flat Bread - Bland and doughy. Toppings and flavors didn't go together well.\nOctapussy - Batter was bland and dried out.\nNuttin' Honey - Overly sweet and overall just not a good dish.\n\nThe Ugly (horrible):\n\nPoona Tuna - EW! Bland, flavorless, horrible texture.\nAsada - Totally inedible. One bite, worst thing here.\n\nWe tried ordering the tater tots and the corn dogs, but they were out of these two items. Other notables from my friends were that they felt the Cow Pie was bland and just overall a horrible burger and that the hummus was an almost inedible and thick consistency. I heard from another friend at my table that the meaty balls and the surf & turf were just \"ok,\" nothing they'd recommend, but not horrible.\n\nThe service would have to go in \"The Ugly\" category as well. We were roped into an 18% gratuity since we were a party of 7, but our waiter was very inattentive and hard to track down for long periods of time, so he definitely deserved less.. When we would request refills he would take forever to come by and when he did he would only refill a few glasses and leave half of them empty and wander away. When he did stick around, he was constantly pressuring us to order beverages. I understand attempting to sell us on drinks, but it was excessive and a little annoying.  \n\nOverall, this place was a big disappointment after looking forward to it all week. Save your money and try a buffet in town, like the M or Wicked Spoon, and if you're really in the mood for tapas, just head straight to Firefly. \n\nThis place is really not worth your time.", "type": "review", "business_id": "EQQOPKL3rmPsH73IF7kvjw"}

It's actually kind of sweet, which I wasn't expecting, but they gave me a bottle of their excellent hot sauce and that solved the problem.  It's super yummy!  It comes with avocado and a big chunk of cotija cheese in the middle.  I know the cotija cheese may sound weird, but is actually really, really good.  I talked to the nice man who took my order and he said they can make the burrito more spicy next time.\n\nWhile I was there, they blasted I Will Always Love You by Whitney Houston, More Than Words by Extreme, and the theme song to Annie!  Crazy!  I Will Always Love You has been stuck in my head since.\n\nNext time, I tried the beef tacos and ordered them actually spicy. Which apparently means you order them regular but spicy. The tacos were also very, very good.  Overstuffed tacos with lots of cilantro and cabbage.  You can't possibly keep everything in the taco but it makes a nice little salad when stuff falls out and they give you a fork so it's all good!  The friendly man taking orders came out and gave me a mixture of jalapenos, celery, and soy sauce to put on my tacos.  Very yummy and not overpoweringly spicy.\n\nThe music... they blasted Creep by TLC and, again, I Will Always Love You!  Nooooo!

What an unusual and great take on your typical burger joint, I am a fan after today's lunch.\n\nI haven't been on this side of the Park/Woodlawn cluster since this location was a Mama Fu's.  If you can get past the lunchtime Chick-Fil-A line on Woodlawn to get into ParkTowne Village, you will be rewarded at the Nom.  The parking is an exercise in patience and reflexes during peak lunch hours, but I went around 11:30 and they hadn't started hitting people or ramming bumpers yet.  If you park behind the shops, where most of the storefronts are located, you can take the very steep stairs next to Qdoba to get to Nom, or if you go past Qdoba, there is an elevator to get to the ground floor.\n\nI was the first one in for lunch and had the place to myself for about 15 minutes.  Right at noon folks started to file in, and I am hoping they filled even more after I left.  Clean space, with a lovely relaxing blue water feature.  There is also a flat screen TV in one corner (not sure what was on, I had a magazine with me).  There is mostly table/chair seating, but along one side there is a mixture of bench/chair/table seating.  There is also a LOT of outdoor seating available at heavy metal tables and chairs, but it was a bit warm out for me.  I did notice that at around 12:30 when I left, most of the patio seating is in the shade and there was a nice breeze so you won't melt unless it's a full-on Carolina summer day.\n\nIt is a please wait to be seated place, and the friendly hostess let me have my pick of tables.  My waitress came shortly thereafter and took my order, she was friendly, but could have been a little quicker.  I was in and out within my allotted lunch time, even with ordering an appetizer and a burger.  I also got to finish my appetizer before my burger hit the table - BIG points for that, I hate getting my meal right on top of my starter.  \n\nThe food:\nPan fried pot stickers ($5.50 for 6 - I have uploaded a photo) - Well flavored filling.  The dumplings were not greasy, the wrappers were not sticky or slimy - excellent.  The dipping sauce tasted great and wasn't overly salty like some are.\nNot So Lonely Bird ($6 Tuesday lunch special) w/ sweet potato fries (comes with shrimp chips or regular fries, sweet potato fries are $1 extra, which is clearly marked on the menu - I have uploaded a photo) - DEEEE-licious!  Large turkey burger on a buttery bun with provolone, BACON, spinach, mango salsa and spicy aioli.  I am not a turkey burger girl at all - I like beef.  I like beef a lot.  I equate turkey burgers with being dry and tasteless and this was moist and full of smoky flavor.  The mango salsa added a very mildly sweet texture, balanced with the very slightly spicy aioli.  I would totally order this again.  The sweet potato fries were slightly thicker than shoestring and were crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  Very lightly seasoned, very yummy.  \nCoke products to drink - YAY!\n\nLunch (drink, appetizer, burger) was $15.70 and well worth it.  A tasty, different lunch and I will definitely be returning for more Nom.", "type": "review", "business_id": "UftBjKdS_q7x9z8l8ULJZQ"}

I've experience better.\" race. I've done big races, I've done small races, I've even done other R'n'R races and this was my least enjoyable half marathon experience to date. The novelty of running down the strip at night is cool, but the execution is still lacking.\n\nMy annoyance actually began at the expo because I am the person who wants to pick up my number and get the heck out of there. I hate that they funnel you through aisles of booths to escape because seriously guys, I'm not buying anything and it's all the same crap you have at all the other expos so it's not even novel. The one upside was that we came to the expo super late so they weren't charging for parking.\n\nWe'd chosen to stay at an off strip hotel because my preference is always to stay off strip, so we ran into some traffic getting to the start on race day - no big deal, we allotted extra time and were fine. What DID waste time and was annoying was the total lack of signage or volunteers who were capable of directing us into the starting festival for gear check. If it hadn't been that there was a large group of people having the same issue, we wouldn't have figured out where the hell to go. \n\nI've done big races before that they try to estimate when your corral will be released (because if it's a 4:30 start but your corral wont' go until 5:05 there's no reason to make you stand around). I would have really appreciated that because there were just SO many people running in SO many corrals, it did take a good 40 minutes after the clock time to get going. \n\nThe course itself was fun while on the strip, but as other people have stated in their race reports, everything from the strip over to Fremont really needed better lighting and course support because it still felt super sketchy. I personally had a pretty slow run due to coming off being sick and getting terrible sleep the night before, but I think I was securely middle of the pack and they were out of GU by the time I got to the GU stop. As much as I appreciate all the volunteers at the water stops, giving them a quick professionalism talk before the run wouldn't have hurt either. Many of them were too busy goofing off with each other to keep the cups on their table filled with water or they wouldn't think to tell the runners standing around waiting that the next table had more pre poured cups.\n\nOnce I got done shuffling along for 13.1 miles (I'm slow, I already mentioned that), the finish area was just more annoyance. I couldn't find bottled water. Whatever, it's fine, I'll take a gatorade. I had seen the bagels and apples sitting out baking in the sun hours and hours earlier, so no thanks to those. Being forced to walk through the massively long finishers area when I didn't want ANY of the things they were offering (No times a million, I DO NOT NEED A FINISHER PHOTO!) was lame and I would have been super happy if they'd had participant exits on the sides. I get the need to make it a secure area to limit people coming in, but it's ridiculous that they can't let finishers out. It literally look me 15 minutes to trek from the finish line to the end of the secure area with all the people and crap they were being given.\n\nI would be much more forgiving of the event because I get that it is a truly unique experience, but it's way too expensive to not be awesome. Deep down I'm glad I did it - but I'll never do it again; It's just not worth the cost and annoyance.", "type": "review", "business_id": "M4aGbEXZjOnBFn9C6IbrYQ"}

Seriously. Disappointing.  I guess I should start by saying the food tasted good, but it certainly was not WOW good. And for the prices we paid, it was not good enough.\n\nFirst of all there is no table service. You stand in line to place your order at a counter.  This is something that you expect when ordering / eating fast food, but, again, the prices are ridiculously high for not being a full service restaurant.  OK. So you place your order where you are faced with a somewhat insulting sign that states credit cards are destroying small businesses. As a small business owner myself, accepting credit cards is part of the cost of doing business. Then to use a credit card to pay for your food, you are then charged a RIDICULOUSLY high fee of $1.00 by the cashier.  Look I don't know everything there is to know about credit card processing fees but even when I was selling high-risk services I never paid more than a $0.35 transaction fee + 3%. So for a $6 meal of two tacos, worst case, Guedo's is paying $0.53. But, unless they are really business-stupid, and they are actually paying these high fees for a low-risk business like food service. They are significantly gouging their customers who want to pay with a credit card. Then, to add insult to injury, the credit card slip has a place to add a tip.  A tip? For what? Taking my order, that you're not even going to deliver to my table? \n\nSo, we place our order and find a seat. The restaurant is dark and while there seems to have at some point been an effort at making the place seem festive, with a Taco Beach kind of theme, now the darkness seems to be intentionally aimed at hiding how run-down the place feels. A large open floor space area near the kitchen in the front of the house has a bunch of stuff stored on the floor out in the open. It just looks like they have completely given up. \n\nAll of that could have been overlooked, though, if the food had been worth it. I ordered two tacos, which they charge $3 each for. My date's burrito was about $7. Now, these prices would not be too bad if there was some semblance of quantity.  My $3 tacos were the size of street-vendor tacos. Two small tortillas with some meat added.  That's it. Honestly, you can get these for $1 to $1.50 anywhere else and there would be way more meat between the sheets.  It was pitiful looking down at these two little tacos not even half-filled.   My date's $7 dollar burrito was the size of something you get at Del Taco for less than half the price. A plain tortilla wrapped around (again) a minimal amount of meat, beans, sauce, etc.  \n\nThe flavor of the food was good but not nearly good enough to justify these prices.\n\nThis was such a disappointing lack of food, that after eating everything we received, we ended up heading next door to the fast-food burger joint to get some food to fill us up.  How sad is that?\n\nThis place came highly recommended to us, and while I agree the food is tasty, I have no plans to return.  And based on how few customers were there, I suspect others have come to the same conclusion.", "type": "review", "business_id": "T_Kcz_bkhE9T6YejqFqPxQ"}

Seriously, the best little hole in the wall Mexican restaurant I've come across in a long, long time. Full disclosure, there's nothing fancy, sophisticated or swank here. But man oh man, the food is superb. They offer the obligatory chips and salsa. The chips are run of the mill but the salsa is good. It's simple and will satisfy all levels of spicy tolerance - a hint of heat but not scorching. My dining companions each ordered a chimichanga, one had chicken, the other carnitas. To be honest, neither of them were all that impressed with the chimis but I had so much food that I shared with them. On future visits (and there will be plenty), they now know what to get. I got the 2 combination plate with a chili rellano and a green chili pork enchilada. The rellano was outstanding - cheesy, slightly spicy, with just the right amount of breading. I got it wet with a red sauce and it was perfect. They offer it dry but the red sauce was so good I don't think I'd want it any other way. The green chili pork enchilada was amazing - perfectly cooked pork, not dry at all, just the right amount of cheese, the top smothered with cheese - but not too much. The rice and beans were typical - nothing to write home about but not bad, either. We got a fried ice cream to share and it was good - I've had better but I definitely didn't turn my spoon away from it, either. \n\nAs far as customer service, the bussers, servers, food runners and cashiers were all very helpful and friendly. We didn't wait long for our food and anything we asked for was given to us promptly. We were there at 7pm on a Friday night and it was pretty busy. The dining room is fairly small - maybe around 15 tables and booths so it's not a stretch to say that you may have to wait for a table - but we got sat right away and didn't notice anyone that had to wait. Only thing that was annoying was that they don't take American Express - good thing I had cash. \n\nBottom line, if you're looking for a Mexican  restaurant with great food and service, this is a good bet. If you're looking for something hip, trendy and snobby, go elsewhere. We won't miss you!", "type": "review", "business_id": "btuXBnJEIkn7ax2TfvHQyw"}

Upon walking in, we were greeted by a hostess a few cards short of a full deck.  Bless her heart,  I will give more details on her in a moment.  I go for sushi all the time and one great thing about the sushi experience is how guests are ALWAYS greeted by the sushi chefs.  That won't happen here. All doom and gloom and unfriendly....One of the chefs, I can only describe as \"sour face\".  He comes up later in my review. We were shown to our table where I got to sit on a VERY cracked lucite chair.....thank god I am small, but I still worried about it giving way beneath me.  The menu had an average selection of the \"same ol, same ol\" sushi rolls.  We decided on the assorted sushi platter.  Nothing exciting.  I did have to send back 2 dirty plates that still had rice baked on them.  After we placed our order, I made a quick trip to the ladies room to wash my hands.  As I passed the hostess, l noticed her fully engaged in writing on some paper, as got closer, I saw that she was really drawing stick people with a thick blue marker.   Like something a 5 year old would do.  OK!  Didn't know quite how to process that. But moving on.  After I returned to the table, we heard another party yelping at the table behind us.  Talking about a cougar roll.  So we added it to our order. Our disappointing assorted sushi  platter came.  For $22.00 I expected better.  The quality was eh...  Rubber octopus.....squishey room temperature eel, fake crab.\nThen the cougar roll came, $14.00 for imitation crab in a cucumber slathered with sweet chili sauce.  I dont get it?  But others liked it.  I had also asked for fresh wasabi, I was brought the portion size of one teaspoon. No kidding.  I am not doubting it was fresh, but it was mixed with something else because it was really liquidy?  It was ok.  However, it was not worth the extra $2.00 charge.  The waitresses was stunned we were charged for it, and although we didn't dispute the charge, she thought it was unfair enough to take it up with old \"sour face\".  He was totally rude to her and was irritated she challenged the extra charge.\nOur waitresses was the only good thing about the whole place.  Over priced, average food.  A total, DNR, Do Not Return.

Another great food adventure on behalf of yelpers. \n\nHubs and I both ordered the Tonkatsu sandwich, which comes with a nice side of Japanese potato salad (didn't know there was such a thing), and a bowl of miso soup. Little man (4 y.o.) had the karaage chicken.\n\nService was fast and nondescript. \n\nEach guest gets a mortar and pestle to grind up sesame seeds for their katsu sauce - gave us something to do while we waited for our food and was a fun activity for little man.\n\nThe Tonkatsu sandwiches...huge, tender, and just the right amount of crispness. Japanese potato salad...pretty tasty, coming from someone that doesn't like apples (has small chunks in the potato salad). And yes, weird I'm not a fan of apples. \n\nGood miso soup, nice flavor and didn't seem like it came from instant miso packets; seemed like the same quality you get at sushi restaurants. \n\nKaraage chicken...not as tasty, but this is in comparison to the tasty as heck Tonkatsu. Little man seemed to like it though, basic enough to order for kids. If your little one is a picky eater, just ask that they put the chicken on a separate plate because the order usually comes with a little salad and places the chicken on a bed of cabbage. The actual katsu entree portions looked huge, so next time I'll probably just share an entree with little man. I could barely get thru the sandwich! \n\nWe'll be back!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "YxQ1ssiSvjmprGHKygKfcg"}

I think the reviews would have jaded me and this place is GREAT. I mean it.

Our server was Brittany, she was awesome, very attentive and helpful. Everything on the menu sounds really good. \n\nI started off with their homemade bowtie chicken noodle soup and he got their chili. Both were really good in fact we're going to go there just for the soup and chili one night. Warning the chili has a little kick to it!  The chicken soup was nice and hearty and had real chunks of chicken in it. \n\nI could not resist trying the onion souffl\u00e9. It was so good! Served hot with toasted crostini and melted cheeses. Yes, it's a delicious heart attack in a crock dish. My companion had the pot roast melt. Let's talk about the bread it came on. It came on a bun that had toasted cheese and onions on top of it!! We asked if next time we could get a burger on that bun and they are pretty much willing to do any kind of substitution or make anything you want as long as they have the components. I tried pot roast melt I don't even like pot roast and I liked this one!\n\nSince the food was so good up until that point, I decided to try to bread pudding since it was back by popular demand. My thinking was this has got to be some great bread pudding if it's back. Apparently people were asking for it. It was edible. It was not terrible. But it wasn't the best bread pudding I've ever had. It really wasn't worth all the calories I only ate half of it. Our server did suggest though that we should try the cookie sundae next time, because its better than the bread pudding. I like honest servers and that was very helpful! \n\nWe are definitely going back and they include coupons our server told us in the coupon value packs you get in the mail.", "type": "review", "business_id": "7PQRP9l2cSSqjbQdsXL8yw"}

Nicely done decor. Server was excellent, very friendly and attentive. My first thought was that the prices were high for a cheese sandwich, but I changed my mind when it came...they are HUGE and packed with toppings. I got the \"Big Chebowski\" which had cheddar, smoked gouda, bacon, and a fried egg. It was delicious and huge, I barely finished it. They are VERY greasy between the huge amount of cheese and the buttered bread, so beware! I also upgraded the soup to a mac and cheese, and I'll say theirs is probably the best mac and cheese I've had in this city. I'd come in just for that! The fries served with the sandwich are very good, but I'd say they are too heavy for these decadent sandwiches; I might have preferred something like a shoestring fry with this meal.\n\nCriticisms...the menu is way too big. I'd rather see a handful of their best selections and maybe a couple daily or weekly specials items. The menu includes snacks, appetizers, and sides which seems like a bit much. And salads. (Who comes to places like this and gets a salad???) My husband had the tomato soup with his sandwich and he said it was nothing special. I'm also very surprised they don't have a \"build your own\" option.\n\nAll in all the food and service were excellent and I'll definitely be back in soon.", "type": "review", "business_id": "h27XSUr66bI87J01FsYDpw"}

When I first Got pregnant I didn't have insurance, I was one month away from getting it at my new job and applied for their OB Package, My Appt was at 2:30 and was not seen until 4:30. The worker was very rude basically because I was over income and did not qualify for assistance at all, She actually made me feel bad for even asking for help. I then talked to my work and they added me early to the company  plan to help me out. At my first visit I asked to not use their payment plan and pay that visit and ultrasound in cash at that time. Weeks later I received a bill for $930 dollars the remainder of the original  1200 down payment of the OB plan I no longer needed.  I was Livid I had to call several different people, several Different  times and never got confirmation that is was handled which really stressed me out, I finally had to call back and find out if everything was was done and it was finally taken care of. \n\n2.Out of Control wait times, as I stated above for the financial aid Appt I had to wait 2 hours then on my Appt on 10/22 my Appt Time was 3:40 and was asked to come 20 min early so Arrival at 3:20pm and then was not seen until 5:20 two hours after my arrival time. with no apologies or Explanation,  and no one even in the lobby waiting. \n\n3. the most important,  I had explained to my Doctor, the site manager and the schedulers several times  that I am a heart patient and have had two open heart surgery operations, and still have a weak heart, and  the increase in the blood volume  due to my pregnancy may cause problems for my heart creating proper blood flow for my child and my cardiologist has recommended close monitoring including frequent ultrasounds and  follow up visits. I would be considered a high risk pregnancy, and I was not being treated as such.  after my visit on 10/22 where I did not receive an ultra sound I requested the DR be asked if he could make sure at my next visit I had one  I asked the scheduler to get the authorization from the dr,  for my next appt,  and I would like a call back so my boyfriend could also take time off to be there, he came last time and I didn't get my ultra sound.  they set the appt and I never got a call back about the ultrasound, I called back 11/1  at 1pm and spoke to another scheduler and my request was not taken care, I asked again that the dr be asked for the authorization, so I can have an ultra sound, on 11/6 in the  morning I got a call from someone in the office and she  said they will not do an ultrasound until 18 or 20 weeks. I was honestly in disbelief.l felt  like Adelante didn't care about me or my unborn child. I have been trying for YEARS to have a child, and had complication after complication,  and was actually told I would never conceive and Finally  my dreams, I thought were coming true, and I was being given the shaft. I really liked my doctor but at this point I needed a doctor and facility who will take my health and concerns seriously\n\nFrom the very start of my Pregnancy I feel as though I have been given the shaft, from the Financial aid worker, making me feel bad because I made to much to qualify  for assistance, to receiving and erroneous bill for $930 Which was taken care of but,  still really stressed me out. To being denied the medically necessary monitoring I required for a healthy baby and pregnancy.  I would recommend highly going elsewhere this place only caters to those on public benefits and  assistance and could care less about hard working people as demonstrated by the schedulers once again My last and final complaint is this, I made an appt for my 1 month follow up Visit on 11/21/13 I asked for the latest appt possible and told that was 4pm( even though last time I wasn't even seen until almost 5:30 pm, I really didn't  want to miss any more work if I didn't have to, and was told 4 pm was the latest they could do even though they say they are open until 7pm.\n\nJust take my advise avoid this place like the plague!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SNNdacxKtzSwWgwakdVIgA"}

For anyone on a budget but looking to do something fun and different this is great. I painted an anchor and my friends went with a scenic tree option. Surprisingly, the place was quiet ( I think because they're pretty new) Casey, the manager was very helpful! This time and my yelp event, I appreciated that the instructors gave direction but also allowed you to have your own artistic spin on it. The location is great, considering you can find parking and you're also located next to a bunch of shops and restaurants.

For brunch, she recommended the raw tuna nachos (aka tuna tartar) dish which was delicious, though a bit pricey. Their sea bass was good, but my favorite was the spicy chicken and sweet potato hash.

They lied to me. Glass and trim was not installed correctly. Emblems were not re-applied in the right spot. My rear wiper motor mount and sprayer was broken during dis-assembly and they tried to hand it back to me hoping I wouldn't notice. The car wasn't even painted properly.

I had to complain to the owner and take the car back again to get it repainted and re-assembled properly.\n\nI am revisiting this review because my wife also used this shop (I went to them because she said she'd had a good experience) and has recently had a bad experience. Less than a year after they'd repaired and re-painted the hood of her car, the paint started flaking off the leading edge in cornflake-sized pieces.

She said we'll give it a try, so we agreed to be seated inside.\n\nWe then were ushered to a table for 2, right behind another couple who were comfortably seated. Instead of cramping behind them, I asked if it was ok to sit one more table down which was empty. She seemed unsure and said ok after I asked if it was ok twice, then continued to say that if they get a table for 6, they would prefer to use this table to join to the table for 4. I, once again, considered leaving, but was again told to give this place a chance.\n\nThe next group of 3 that came to the restaurant asked to be seated outside and were seated outside. What changed in 5 minutes?\n\nAnyways - my wife read the menu in dim lighting and decided to order chili chicken appetizer and a karhai lamb extra spicy entree with onion paneer kulcha and 1 roti. \n\nThe chili chicken (4 tiny pieces in a huge, square plate) came out rubbery while the sauce was good. We had one piece each before deciding to wait for the entree.\n\nThe karhai lamb with kulcha, roti and rice were brought out to our table a few minutes later. I, once again, thought the gravy of the lamb curry was decent  - but neither of us could chew through even one of the lamb pieces. I have had enough lamb dishes from many different cuisines to know that this was probably how chewing on rubber feels like. We left the curry, all lamb pieces and rice untouched - we both had one piece each of the roti.\n\nWe did contemplate if we should speak with the manager, but decided against. I had just had enough and simply wanted to leave. I wonder why many of my colleagues rave about this place; even why yelpers rate this place highly - I can only attribute it to the lack of authentic, Indian restaurants in the area or being mesmerized by the dim, blue, gimmicky interior design of the restaurant. \n\nPassage to India, Spice 9, Cafe Nirvana, Maharani Indian Restaurant are all better choices.", "type": "review", "business_id": "t9A1tZsgs7eJrEW2CBmPUg"}

I'd heard about it from others like some sort of ancient mythology - it sounds amazing and fantastical but you know it can't really be true.  When it comes to Lo-Lo's - believe the hype.\n\nFinding Lo-Lo's: I've driven down Central SO many times and never known how close I really was.  Then one day I saw an arrow spray painted on the side of the building.  \"Lo-Lo's this way!\"  It took a few minutes to realize that that must be THE Lo-Lo's.  I started talking about it w/ friends and we decided we needed to go.  I confirmed the address and the 3 of us set off for flavor adventure.  Yes, you turn at the arrow (Which you only see when driving North on Central) and it's not much at all past that - but don't expect any huge signs, valet service - or even a parking lot.  You'll park right out on the street - and on a busy night that means you may need to walk a bit.\n\nEntering Lo-Lo's:  Stepping through the doors = Waiting area.  Taking 2 steps into Lo-Lo's = Standing in front of someone's table while they are eating.  You can tell this used to be someone's house - and it was a small house at that.  There are just a few \"rooms\" for seating - and the largest has 5 tables.  Our first time there we sat in the room that has just two tables - a 4 and a 2 top - but it's also where the cash register is, where folks pick up to go orders, where they refill the drinks/silverware, where they store extra items that were purchased in bulk and has the doorway to the kitchen and you have to walk through that room to get to the other rooms.  In some places you might think this was the worst table in the house.  At Lo-Lo's I would disagree with you.  We got to listen in on the best conversations and we had the best view of all the amazing food going to the different rooms.  \n\nThe Food:  Sweet Tea served in a big Mason Jar.  SOLD!  It was awesome and the refills kept coming.  Soul Food without Sweet Tea is just wrong to me.  As for the rest of the Menu - it's not 30 pages long - in fact I'm pretty sure it's just one piece of paper written on both sides.  And yet it's still SO hard to choose.  The first time we went each of us got something slightly different.  Both my eating companions got some version of a meal that included both Chicken and Waffles.  I bucked the trend and got their Salmon Croquettes with Cheese Eggs, Grits and Waffles.  I could talk for days about how amazing their food is.  Best Eggs I'd ever had.  I am not a big egg person and I was craving these eggs again for a month.  The more I think about them the more I want to go.  The Salmon was amazing - I took one home and it was big enough I made myself a sandwich with it the next day.  The sides are all absolutely amazing.  The Greens have an amazing sweetness aftertaste that I am completely unable to describe.  The Chicken.  Oh, the Chicken.  Let's start w/ this.  I've always thought fried chicken was \"ok\".  I went with 2 folks who love fried chicken - and make their own family handed down recipes.  After their first bites it looked like they had found the holy grail.  It was the best fried chicken I'd ever eaten.  Guess what I've saved for last?  The waffles.  I always eat waffles or pancakes last for 2 reasons 1) They are SO sweet just like a desert and 2) I can only eat a few bites worth.  They are usually too sweet, too sticky, and very quickly mushy.  So, I spread around the butter (removing most of it of course) and drizzled it with some syrup.  It was the lightest, yummiest, buttery heavenly thing I'd ever had.  These were not just waffles.  These were Waffles.  I ate almost the whole thing.  As for Lo-Lo's desert menu - I've heard great things about their Red Velvet cake - but I've never quite been able to get that far into my meal and still order more.  Maybe next time.\n\nService: We've always had great service.  Servers are usually young and have that \"I'm working at my uncle's restaurant for the summer\" quality - but they are fast, knowledgeable and quick on the refills. \n\nAtmosphere: If you are from certain parts of the valley - Lo-Lo's may be a bit of a culture shock.  Yes, it is quite possible if you are of the Caucasian persuasion - you may be the only one there during your entire meal.  I've heard some folks say they would be \"afraid\" to go because of that.  My thought?  Get the heck over it.  Should a black person be afraid to go to AZ 88 or Flemings because they might be the only black person there?  Heck no.  And wouldn't you think they were silly for even thinking it?  Exactly.\n\nOverall: Prices are good.  I honestly can't remember how much anything costs.  I blame the food.  But I do remember thinking \"wow, is that all?\" every time we go.  Location is downtown - just minutes from AWA.  Food is out of this freaking world.  Calorie content is... well...  it's not something I like to think about.", "type": "review", "business_id": "K8pM6qQdYu5h6buRE1-_sw"}

Their burgers are freshly cooked in front of you and their fries are absolutely delicious. They have a toppings station where they have burger toppings as well as dipping sauces and condiments.

Give Postino Central time to hire a service focused staff with a sense of urgency before you come here. \n\nThe arrival of Postino in my 'hood was highly anticipated.  I was hoping the new \"central\" location would be \"inspired\" by Postino... not an Exact replica.. Which was a little boring!  We arrived at 7:30 to a full bar.. Which, a full bar is nothing new for this restaurant group, so why did it seem so chaotic? \n\nWe found some seats at the bar and waited to be served... and waited... and waited... we counted 3-4 on bar staff... yet the \"main'\" bartender seemed pre-occupied, and easily distracted.. AHAD?  We were finally acknowledged after 10 mins and placed our orders. \n\n As we looked around, we noticed others at the bar with either an empty drink or no drink at all. (Amazing that the owner was monitoring the restaurant, however did not pick up on the fact so many at the bar had to wait so long for service) \n\nThere was one lucky group at the bar, ( We think they were the original cast from  the movie Sixteen Candles  ) that enjoyed exceptional service and attention.. Full drinks at all times, maintaining the bartender's attention as the rest of the patrons suffered.  Perhaps they hypnotized or used voodoo on the staff... Hey ...whatever it takes... I guess I'll go to a graveyard and kill a chicken at midnight before my next visit! \n\nThe bruschetta we ordered was great, the same quality as the Campbell location.  Warm, thickly sliced artisan bread, covered with generous amounts of toppings.  Our favorites were the prosciutto, Fig and mascarpone cheese and the Apple & Brie.. yummy!!!  The food was the only reason I gave this night a 2 star.  \n\nAlthough we fought our better judgment to leave after we enjoyed  our food... we stayed.  Big mistake!  We foolishly thought  once Jake Ryan and Caroline Mulford left the bar , the voodoo spell would be broken, that was not the case...the wait for the following drinks were just as lengthy as the first!\n\nIf I were the owner, .. I'd replace the Bar Staff with the Valet Staff.. The Valet Staff was quicker, service focused  and had more personality then anyone at the bar..\n\nI look forward to returning back to Postino Central when they have \"ironed out\" the \"kinks\"..", "type": "review", "business_id": "3n9mSKySEv3G03YjcU-YOQ"}

Byriani, Sagg and Red Fort were our standard orders although the Dupiaza was also pretty good.

They also have a, I believe it's called, Managers Reception in the evening with drinks and light hours devours.  \n\nThe pool & sauna area is great.  The bathrooms have towels for your convenience.  I really like the patio seating areas around the pool.  My family and I were able to enjoy our complimentary breakfast outside while the weather was gorgeous.  My 6-yr old daughter especially loved the pool since she was able stand up in the shallow end.  Although the pool is a little small.\n\nThe lobby area has a huge pretty ponds and a fountain.  Makes you feel relaxed as you enter.\n\nThe negatives:\n1. Since we were guests of the wedding party, we didn't have to pay for parking during our stay but they normally charge for parking.\n2. The Fitness Center is way too small and is an a very odd location.  It's on the 3rd floor, closer to one side of the building, but still in the middle not too far from some of the rooms.  The room is surrounded by glass and only part of it is frosted so it's easy for guests walking around to see in.\n3.  Most of the staff was pretty friendly during both of my visits.

I should've asked for the woman's name but when she delivered the towels she was extremely rude.  She didn't smile or say hi, which was no biggie, but she delivered bath towels.  Again, no biggie, we ended up needing them anyway but when I nicely told her that we had requested the smaller hand-towels, she rolled her eyes, started speaking into her radio and walked away.

A few draw backs were that they do not (or didn't when we were there) have a breakfast buffet and I saw a billboard for free Wi-Fi, but it was only in the lobby and the coffee shop, not the rooms (didn't think it was worth the billboard if it wasn't for the rooms.) All in all, a great time and the aquarium is a must see.\n\n(update) I am very thankful for the coupons they send for free stays. It makes it all the more tempting to visit Las Vegas which is just a quick drive from Phoenix.  :-) That's enough to give it 4 stars.", "type": "review", "business_id": "l2rEBS7iKgIteBe0KgB5Ng"}

Silver Nugget has cheap bowling until 5PM. They have 24 well oiled lanes that are easy to bowl on. Never once did the fence get stuck. Nor did the ball return. No complaints there. Beers were cheap too. Certainly no complaints there. A good place to bowl. Nothing fancy but far from a dive. I'll be back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "C2p26Pp3DUP3o-yR_I8Zfw"}

The vanilla ice cream was okay. It was icy and could not taste any vanilla. It reminded me of soft serve.  My daughter had a strawberry cupcake with strawberry ice cream.

I've been meaning to try his fine dining for a while now, after reading so many good reviews and this was the perfect opportunity to sample some of his fine dining at an affordable price.\nWe had booked a table for 7.30 pm and when we arrived, the lovely lady at the reception took us to our table, which was a nice corner table. We were quite surprised that the restaurant was so quiet, but I guess it is mid term holiday this week, and it was a Tuesday.  I have to admit that I felt a bit self conscious as we were the only ones in the room but our hostess was lovely and chatty.\nWe ordered our food and as we had both opted for the pork as a main and were a bit uncertain about the wine, we were recommended a reasonably priced Pinot Grigio. \nAfter a very short wait, we were brought a delicious pea and mint amuse-bouche.  I love when restaurants do that.  It's very common in France but you only seem to get it in fine dining places in Scotland. That was certainly a lovely start to the meal.\nFor starter, G had gone for the terrine and after hesitating all day between the cullen skink and the ravioli, I opted for the ravioli.  I do love cullen skink but this was too good an opportunity not to try that delicious sounding dish! Both starter plates looked very pretty and were a pleasure to the palate.\nThe main course then arrived.  I had been looking forward to that slow cooked pork all day and it certainly looked as pretty as it tasted!  The crackling is just soooo good with a little bit of salt. Divine! Now, I did say on twitter that I would have liked the texture of cooked apple with it, but that's probably just because I'm French!  The dish is fantastic and the puree and the jus were very delicate and delicious.  \nOur waitress was very attentive and the service was quick. We were offered pudding but didn't opt for it as we were feeling full and were left to finish our bottle of wine.\nI haven't mentioned that the restaurant is nicely and tastefully decorated, the lighting is quite low, which make a pleasant and intimate atmosphere, and I did like the background music, which was jazzy enough to create an atmosphere but not overpowering at all.\nI can't wait to go back, and will happily save some pennies to be able to afford the normal price!\nAlso, I haven't found out how to add pictures to a review but I have posted the pictures to the restaurant's profile so everybody can admire the faultless presentation.\nHats off Mr Greenaway, and thank you for partnering with Yelp!", "type": "review", "business_id": "egaieBcnSZLYGl1N-_CtvQ"}

It was so cute! The whole place has great atmosphere and charm! So glad a friend introduced me to this Phoenix gem! \n\nSince I am a creature of habit, and because I have been craving the Forbidden Rice and Veggies since my last trip, I went for the sure bet. Was just as good as I have been dreaming and was even considerably different due to a new variety of veggies. \n\nDue to my rec, my carnivorous dining companion opted for the same dish, claiming it was his first ever without protein, but is now convinced that my life as a veg is not so bland after all. \n\nWill be back for more! :)", "type": "review", "business_id": "uKSX1n1RoAzGq4bV8GPHVg"}

The asada was fantastic and their tortillas are made fresh and taste delicious. the way they cook and season their meats is fantastic and can rival any taco truck in Los Angeles.
